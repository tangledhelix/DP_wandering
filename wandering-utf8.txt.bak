PREFACE.


It might be offered as a sufficient reason for writing this
book that no other treatise on the same subject exists in
our language. But to this it may be added, that in pamphlets
that have appeared in other languages, the relations of
the Legend with Eastern mythology have been little considered,
and its connection with Hebrew and Christian
mythology almost ignored. Furthermore, those studies of the
Legend which I have read consider it mainly as a curiosity.
But the subject, as it appears to me, possesses a larger significance.
Even the poems and romances it has suggested
fail to render the still sad music of humanity pervading the
variations of the folk-tale itself.

The Legend of the "Wandering Jew" is an example of
how the folk-tale may sometimes be a mirror brought by
Truth from the bottom of her well--the heart of the child-like
world--wherein may be seen by reflection things that
few eyes can look upon directly. The splendours now
gathered around a triumphant Christ conceal from many
the face of the changeling really there. But children, fools,
and folk-lore speak the truth. The modern French song
says, "Jesus, who is goodness itself, sighing said, Thou shalt
march till Judgment Day." There is a touch of sceptical
sophistication here. But among the many earlier songs,
ballads, stories, there is not one which betrays the faintest
suspicion of anything in the curse on the Wanderer not characteristic
of Jesus. No one tried to soften the case. Another
widespread legend relates that once when Jesus begged bread
of a baker, the dough prepared for him was reduced, before
being placed in the oven, by the baker's daughter; whereupon
Jesus taught her the beauty of kindness by changing
her into a deathless owl. Ophelia murmurs: "They say
the owl was a baker's daughter. Lord, we know what we
are, but know not what we may be." These last words
would not have been inappropriate for the owl to address to
a Christ whose transformation her own reflected. Is
this only a fantastic tale? It is coinage of the creed
that a human word or action may find its fair measure in
ages of penalty. In it is the fictitious equation of every
theology which unites ancient divinities not subject to
moral laws with human ideals. The sacerdotal sorcery
which for the lover of enemies substituted a curser of
enemies is discoverable in the earliest Christian theology;
but the working out of it among the masses is not told in
histories. The true record remains to be written, and the
materials for it are indestructibly preserved in such legendary
lore as this of the Wandering Jew.

THE WANDERING JEW.




THE WANDERING JEW.




I.

THE LEGEND.


In the year 1228, an Armenian bishop visited
England; and the purport of his conversation is
recorded in the <i>Historia Major</i>, begun by Roger de
Wendover and completed (anno 1259) by Matthæus
Parisius. The interviews between the monks and the
Armenian took place at St. Albans, through Henri
Spigurnel, a French interpreter, a native of Antioch
and servant of the bishop; and if the replies of the
Eastern prelate were rightly rendered, his tendency
to the marvellous was sufficiently strong. He was
asked, for instance, whether he had seen Noah's Ark,
said to be still preserved on an Armenian mountain,
and he replied "Yes." He was also asked whether
he knew anything of "the famous Joseph," so much
discussed, said to have been preserved from the time
of the crucifixion of Christ, as a witness of that
event. The interpreter said that the personage in
question had dined with his master shortly before
they left Armenia, and then gave the story as
follows. The name of the wonderful Jew was
originally Cartaphilus, and he was Pilate's doorkeeper
at the time of Christ's trial. When the young
men were leading Jesus out from the hall of judgment,
this doorkeeper struck him on the neck, and
said, "Go, Jesus; go on faster: why dost thou linger?"
Jesus turned, and answered, "I will go, but thou shalt
remain waiting until I come." (Here is quoted Matt.
xxvi. 24: "The Son of man goeth as it is written of
Him; but woe unto that man by whom the Son of
man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if
he had not been born.") Thenceforth Cartaphilus
has been waiting. He was thirty years when he
insulted Christ, and whenever he reaches the age of
one hundred he faints; on his recovery he finds
himself as young as when his doom was pronounced.
(Which, again, reminds the Chronicler of a text, Ps.
ciii. 5: "Thy youth is renewed like the eagle's;"
and no doubt he was coming near a myth to
which this item of the story is related, that of the
Phœnix.) It was further related that Cartaphilus
had been baptized by Ananias (who baptized Paul)
under the name of Joseph. He lives among eminent
Christians in Armenia as a holy man; relates to
them and to others who visit him, sometimes from
great distances, much concerning the Apostles: he
never smiles, but sometimes weeps; refuses gifts, is
frugal, and talks little. He hopes for final forgiveness,
because he knew not what he did. The Chronicle
adds that this story was attested by Richardus de
Argentomio, who visited the East.

The same archbishop is quoted for the story told
in the <i>Chronique rimée</i> of Philippe de Mousket, born
1220, Bishop of Tournai in 1682. When the Jews
were leading Jesus to execution, "this man" (no name
is given) said, "Wait for me: I also am going to see
the false prophet fastened to the cross." Jesus turned
upon him and said, "They will not wait for thee, but
thou shalt wait for me." This man would seem to
have been a Jew, whereas Cartaphilus was a Roman.

These are the earliest written records of the legend
of the Wandering Jew. From that time no trace of it
appears until the year 1547, when an individual
seems to have appeared in Hamburg, pretending to
be the Wandering Jew himself. The legend and its
representative appeared in German annals simultaneously.
The fullest account is in a work published
1613: <i>Newe Zeitung von einem Juden von Jerusalem,
Ahasuerus genannt, welcher die Creutzigung unsers
Herrn Jhesu Christi gesehen, und noch am leben ist,
aus Dantzig an einem guten Freund geschrieben</i>. The
name appended to this narrative is "Herr Chrysostomus
Duduläus Westphalus," which Grässe believes
a pseudonym. The author, however, embodies statements
made in an earlier work: <i>Strange Report of a
Jew, born at Jerusalem, named Ahasuerus, who pretends
he was present at the crucifixion of Christ.
Newly printed at Leyden, Leipzig, 1602.</i> From the
same source came, <i>True likeness of the whole form of
a Jew, seen by all, from Jerusalem, who pretends, etc.
First printed at Augspurg, 1619.</i> The narrative of
Westphalus is as follows:

"Paulus von Eizen, Doctor and Bishop of Schleswig,
related to me, some years ago, that at the time
he was studying at Wittenberg, while on a visit to
his parents at Hamburg, in 1547, he had seen in
church, placed near the chancel, a very tall man, with
hair falling on his shoulders, barefoot, who listened to
the sermon with great attention; and whenever the
name of Jesus was mentioned, bowed humbly, smote
his breast, and sighed. His only clothing was a pair
of trousers, ragged at the ends, and a coat tied with
a cord which fell to his feet. He appeared to be fifty
years of age. There seem to have been many of the
nobility and gentry who have seen this man, in England,
France, Italy, Hungary, Persia, Spain, Poland,
Moscow, Lieffland, Sweden, Denmark, and Scotland,
and in other regions. Everyone has marvelled much
at him. And the aforenamed Doctor, having made
inquiries as to where he could converse with this
man, and having found him, asked him whence he
came, and how long he had been there during that
winter. On this the man very humbly told him
that he was by birth a Jew of Jerusalem, named
Ahasuerus, his occupation that of a shoemaker; that
he had been present at the crucifixion of Christ, since
which time he had been alive; that he had travelled
through many countries and cities; and to prove that
he was telling the truth, he had knowledge of various
events which had occurred since that time, as well as
of all the events which had happened to Christ when
he was brought before Pilate and Herod and finally
crucified. He told even more than we know through
the evangelists and historians; and he narrated the
many changes of government, especially in Eastern
countries, which had occurred at one time or another
during those many centuries. Then he related most
minutely the life, sufferings, and death of the holy
Apostles. And now, when Dr. Paulus of Eizen, with
great interest and astonishment, had heard these
things, in order to obtain more thorough knowledge,
he asked him to relate exactly all that happened.
Thereupon this man answered that, at the time of the
crucifixion, he resided in Jerusalem, and like others
he regarded Christ as a heretic; he had not thought
of him otherwise than as a misleader of the people;
and that with others he had endeavoured to get one
who in his eyes was a rebel out of the world. Soon
after the sentence had been pronounced by Pilate,
they led Jesus past his house. Knowing that he
would be led that way, he (Ahasuerus) had gone
home, and told all in his house that they might see
Jesus pass by and would know what kind of man he
was. Just as Jesus was passing, he took a child in
his arms and stood before his own door. Christ,
bearing a very heavy cross on his shoulders, stopped
a little before the shoemaker's door and leaned
against the wall. Then the shoemaker, full of sudden
anger, and also desirous of public applause, told
Christ to move on whither he was ordered. Upon
this, Christ looked sternly upon him, and said, 'I will
stand here and rest, but thou shalt move until the last
day!' Upon this, he put the child down quickly on
the floor, and could stay there no longer. He followed
Jesus, saw him miserably crucified, tortured,
and slain. After all had been fulfilled, it was impossible
for him to enter Jerusalem. He never saw his
wife and child again, but as a sad pilgrim has wandered
through foreign countries one after another.
When after many years he returned once more to
Jerusalem, he found everything sacked and destroyed,
so that he could recognise nothing: not one stone
was left upon another, nor any trace of the former
magnificence visible. What God now intended to do
with him, in leaving him in this miserable life wandering
about in such wretchedness, he could not explain
otherwise than that God wished him to remain until
the Day of Judgment as a living sign against the
Jews, by which the unbelieving and the godless
might be reminded of Christ's death and be turned
to repentance. For his part he would be very happy if
God would take him to heaven out of this vale of tears.

"After this report and conversation, Dr. Paulus of
Eizen asked, as also did the School-Inspector of
Hamburg, who was learned in ancient histories, the
right account of all sorts of things which had occurred
in Eastern countries after Christ's birth and crucifixion.
This man gave a very good and exact report of all
these ancient events: so that people were obliged
to believe in him and his story, and went away
astonished, and saying, that with God all things are
possible--but with man they are inscrutable.

"As to this Jew's life it was very quiet and retired.
He did not talk much, and only when asked a question;
and when invited into a house, he did not eat or
drink much, being abstemious. He never stayed
long in one place. At Hamburg, Dantzig, and elsewhere,
when money was offered, he only accepted
two shillings, which soon after he gave to the poor,
with the remark that he did not need any money;
that the good God would provide for him because he
was penitent for his sin; and what he had ignorantly
done he would submit to God. None ever saw him
laugh. In whatever country he entered he knew the
language at once. At that time he spoke the Saxon
language as one born there. Many people came to
Hamburg, from neighbouring and even distant places,
to see and listen to this man, and believed that something
marvellous was indicated by him, because he
was not only attentive to the Word of God but showed
great reverence, and sighed whenever the name of
God or Christ was pronounced. He could never
hear anyone utter a curse. Whenever the name or
torture or sufferings of God were connected by any
excited person with a curse, he would sigh deeply,
and say, 'Miserable man, miserable creature! wilt
thou take lightly the name of thy Lord and God, and
of his great suffering and torture? Hadst thou seen
it as I did, hadst thou seen how hard the wound of
thy Saviour was for thee and me, thou wouldst rather
do a great harm to thyself than pronounce his name
lightly.' All these things Dr. Paulus of Eizen told
me with truth and sincerity, with many other true
circumstances, which, since then, I have heard from
several old friends who also saw the same man at
Hamburg with their own eyes. Which things, also,
Paul of Eizen saw, and has told with truth and
earnestness.

"Anno 1575. The Secretary Christoph Krause
and Magistrate Jacobus von Holstein had been sent
as ambassadors to the Royal Court of Spain, and
afterwards to the Netherlands, in order to pay the
soldiers who served in the royal [army]; and when
they had returned home again, being near Schleswig,
they solemnly related that they had seen this wonderful
man in Spain, with the identical appearance,
costume, manners, and mode of life. They had
spoken to him personally; and said that at the same
time many besides themselves heard him speak good
Spanish.

"Anno 1599. In Christ's month, a very trustworthy
person wrote from Brunswick to Strasburg
that this wonderful man was then in Vienna, in
Austria, and that he intended to go from thence into
Poland and Dantzig, and after that to Moscow. This
Ahasuerus has been at Lubeck in 1601. And also at
Reffel in Lieffland, and in Cracow, Poland. He was
seen and spoken to by many people in Moscow.

"What now sensible men shall think of all this I
leave to themselves. The providences of God are
marvellous, inscrutable, inexplicable; as time goes
on they will become more so; and they will only
be revealed to us at the last day.

"<i>Dated at Reffel, the first of August, 1613.</i>--<sc>Chrysostomus
Duduläus Westphalus.</sc>"

Other notices of the Wandering Jew are as follows.
Nicolas Heldvaler (<i>Sylva Chronol. Circuli Baltici</i>) says:

"This year (1604) there has appeared a fable of
a Jew who is said to have been a shoemaker in
Jerusalem in the time of Christ, and having on Good
Friday struck Jesus with his shoe-last, cannot die,
but must wander about the world till the last day."

Rodolphe Bouthrays (Botereius), Parliamentary
Advocate of Paris (in his <i>Commentarii de Rebus Historicis
in Gallia et toto pene Orbe gestis</i>, Lib. xi., 1604),
mentions the report as wide-spread in his time. The
following is a translation from his Latin:

"I am afraid that some may charge me with anile
trifling, if I insert in this page the story which is told
in the whole of Europe, concerning a Jew, a contemporary
of the Saviour Christ. Nothing, however, is
more widely-spread, and the vernacular history of our
own countrymen has not blushed to declare it. Thus
I have, as witnesses, those who formerly wrote our
Annals ... that he, not in one century [only] had
been seen and recognised in Spain, Italy and Germany,
but that this year it was he himself who was
seen at Hamburg, anno 1564. Many other things
the vulgar imagine about him, as it is prone to rumours;
which I relate, lest anything should remain
untold."

The following is a translation from the Latin of
Julius Cæsar Bulenger (<i>Historiarium sui Temporis
Libri</i>, Leyden, 1619):

"It was reported at that time that a Jew, a contemporary
of Christ, who for more than a thousand
years had been a vagrant and a wanderer over the
whole world, was still wandering about without meat
and drink, having been condemned to that punishment
by God, because he was the first of the dregs of
the circumcised to cry out that Christ should be fixed
to the Cross, and that Barabbas the robber should be
released from the hook and the terror of the Cross.
Afterwards, when Christ, panting from the weight of
the Cross, would have rested at his workshop, for he
was a mechanic, he ordered Him off with bitter words.
To whom Christ said, Because thou begrudgest me so
little rest, I will rest; and thou without rest shalt
wander. And it is told that presently, in less time
than the telling occupies, the man wandered frantic
and aimless throughout the whole city, that thence
his wanderings continue over the whole world even to
this present day, and that it was the very man who
was seen at Hamburg in the year 1564. 'Credat
Judæus Apella.' I did not see the man at that time,
since I was occupied at Paris, nor did I hear about
him from sufficiently trustworthy authorities."

Louvet mentions seeing him in 1604 at Beauvais,
surrounded by a crowd of children, speaking of the
Passion of Christ. He expresses regret that his contempt
for the fellow prevented his interrogating. He
asked and received alms at a certain house.

S. H. Bangert (<i>Commentatio de ortu vita et excessu
Coleri Jurisconsulti Lubecensis</i>, Lubeck, 1644) mentions
that Coler left a memorandum in his diary to
the effect that "that immortal Jew, who asserted that
he had been present at the crucifixion of Christ, was
at Lubeck on the 14th January, 1603."

Martin Zeiler (<i>Historici Chronologi et Geographi
Celebres Collecti</i>, Ulm, 1653) mentions the Wandering
Jew. Among his Letters Zeiler cites one by Westphalus,
substantially the same as his account (1613)
already quoted, as having been written to one of his
(Westphalus') friends.

In the year 1644 the 'Turkish Spy' writes from
Paris (Book III. Letter I.) to Ibraham Haly Cheik, a
Man of the Law, as follows:

"There is a man come to this city, if he may be
called a man, who pretends to have lived above these
sixteen hundred years. They call him the Wandering
Jew. But some say he is an impostor. He says
of himself that he was Usher of the Divan in
Jerusalem (the Jews call it the Court of Judgment),
where all criminal causes were tried, at the time
when Jesus, the Son of Mary, the Christian's Messias,
was condemned by Pontius Pilate, the Roman President.
That his name was Michob Ader; and that
for thrusting Jesus out of the Hall with these words,
'Go, why tarriest thou?' the Messias answered him
again, 'I go, but tarry thou till I come;' thereby
condemning him to live till the Day of Judgment.
He pretends to remember the Apostles that lived in
those days, and that he himself was baptized by one
of them; that he has travelled through all the regions
of the world, and so must continue to be a vagabond
till the Messias shall return again. They say that he
heals all diseases by touching the part affected.
Divers other miracles are ascribed to him by the
ignorant and superstitious; but the learned, the noble,
the great, censure him as a pretender or a madman.
Yet there are who affirm that 'tis one convincing
argument of the reality of his pretence that he has
hitherto escaped a prison, especially in those countries
where the authors of all innovations are severely
punished. He has escaped the Inquisitions at Rome,
in Spain, and in Portugal, which the vulgar will have
to be an evident miracle.

"One day I had the curiosity to discourse with him
in several languages; and I found him master of all
those that I could speak. I conversed with him five
or six hours together in Arabic. He told me there was
scarce a true history to be found. I asked him what he
thought of Mahomet, the Prophet and Lawgiver of
the Mussulmans? He answered that he knew his
father very well, and had often been in his company
at Ormus in Persia; that Mahomet was a man full
of light and a divine spirit, but had his errors as well
as other mortals, and that his chiefest was in denying
the crucifixion of the Messias; 'for,' said he, 'I was
present, and saw Him hang on the Cross, with these
eyes of mine.' He accused the Mussulmans of
'imposture' in making the world believe that the tomb
of their Prophet hangs miraculously between heaven
and earth, saying that he himself had seen it, and
that it was built after the manner of other sepulchres.
Thou who hast been at the Holy Place knowest
whether this be true or false. He upbraids the
Persian Mahometans with luxury, the Ottomans with
tyranny, the Arabians with robbery, the Moors with
cruelty, and the Mussulmans of the Indies with
atheism. Nor does he spare to reproach the Christian
churches: he taxes the Roman and Grecian with the
pompous idolatry of the heathens; he accuses the
Æthiopian of Judaism, the Armenian of heresy; and
says that the Protestants, if they would live according
to their profession, would be the best Christians.

"He told me he was in Rome when Nero set fire to
the city and stood triumphing on the top of a hill to
behold the flames. That he saw Saladin's return
from his conquests in the East, when he caused his
shirt to be carried on the top of a spear, with this
proclamation: '<i>Saladin, lord of many rich countries,
Conqueror of the East</i>, ever victorious and happy,
when he dies shall have no other memorial left of all
his glories, but only this poor shirt.'

"He relates many remarkable passages of Soliman
the Magnificent, whereof our histories are silent, and
says he was in Constantinople when Soliman built
that royal mosque which goes by his name. He
knew Tamerlane the Scythian, and told me he was so
called because he halted on one leg. He pretends
also to have been acquainted with Scander-Beg, the
valiant and fortunate Prince of Epirus. He seemed
to pity the insupportable calamity of Bajazet, whom
he had seen carried about in a cage by Tamerlane's
order. He accuses the Scythian of too barbarous an
insult on the unfortunate Sultan. He remembers
the ancient Caliphs of Babylon and Egypt, the
empire of the Saracens, and the wars in the Holy
Land. He highly extols the valour and conduct of
the renowned Godfrey de Bouillon. He gives an
accurate account of the rise, progress, establishment
and subversion of the Mamelukes in Egypt. He
says he has washed himself in the two head-springs
of the river Nile, which arise in the southern part of
Æthiopia. That its increase is occasioned by the
great rains in Æthiopia, which swell all the rivers
that fall into the Nile, and cause that vast inundation
to discover whose origin has so much puzzled
philosophy. He says that the river Ganges in India
is broader and deeper than the Nile; that the river
Niger in Africa is longer by some hundreds of miles;
and that he can remember a time when the river
Nile overflowed not till three months after the usual
season.

"Having professed himself an universal traveller,
and that there was no corner of the earth where he
had not been present, I began to comfort myself with
the hopes of some news from the Ten Tribes of Israel
that were carried into captivity by Salmanasar, King
of Assyria, and could never be heard of since. I
asked him several questions concerning them, but
found no satisfactory answer. Only, he told me that
in Asia, Africa, and Europe he had taken notice of a
sort of people who (though not Jews in profession)
yet retained some characteristics whereby one might
discover them to be descended of that nation. In
Livonia, Russia, and Finland he had met with people
of languages distinct from that of the country, having
a great mixture of Hebrew words; that these
abstained from swine's flesh, blood, and things
strangled; that in their lamentations for the dead
they always used these words: <i>Jeru, Jeru, Masco,
Salem</i>. By which, he thought, they called to remembrance
Jerusalem and Damascus, those two famous
cities of Palestine and Syria. In the Circassians also
he had traced some footsteps of Judaism: their
customs, manner of life, feasts, marriages, and sacrifices
being not far removed from the institutions of
Mosaic Law. But, what is most remarkable, he said
that he had conversed with professed Jews in the
north part of Asia who never so much as heard of
Jesus, the son of Mary, or of the revolutions of Judea
after his death, the siege and destruction of Jerusalem,
or any other matters wherewith all histories abound
concerning that nation. He said, moreover, that these
Jews had only the Pentateuch, not having heard of
the rest of those Books which compose the greatest
part of the Old Testament; and that this Pentateuch
was written in a sort of Hebrew far different from that
which is now commonly spoken by the rest of the
Jews dispersed throughout the world. That the
number of these Jews was infinite. And, finally, he
thought that these (if any) were the true posterity of
those Ten Captive Tribes.

"Having mentioned the destruction of Jerusalem,
I asked him where he was at that time? He told
me, in the Court of Vespasian at Rome; and that he
had heard the emperor say, when he understood the
Temple of Solomon was burnt to ashes, 'he had
rather all Rome had been set on fire.' Here the old
man fell a-weeping himself, lamenting the ruin of
that noble structure, which he described to me as
familiarly as if he had seen it but yesterday. He says
that Josephus wrote partially of the seditions in the
city, being related to one of the chief ringleaders,
whom therefore he spared, being loth to stain the
reputation of his own family to all posterity.

"I tell thee, sage Cheik, if this man's pretences be
true, he is so full of choice memoirs, and has been
witness to so many grand transactions for the space
of sixteen centuries of years, that he may not unfitly
be called 'A living Chronology,' the 'Protonotary of
the Christians' Hegira,' or principal recorder of that
which they esteem the last <i>epocha</i> of the world's
duration. By his looks one would take him for a
relic of the Old World, or one of the long-lived fathers
before the Flood. To speak modestly, he may pass
for the younger brother of Time.

"It would be endless to tell thee how many other
discourses we had of his travels and memoirs; till,
tired with his company, and judging all to be a cheat,
I took my leave. I assure thee, he seems to be a man
well versed in all histories, a great traveller, and one
that affects to be counted an extraordinary
person. The common people are ready to adore
him; and the very fear of the multitude restrains the
magistrates from offering any violence to this impostor.

"Live thou in the exercise of thy reason, which
will not permit thee to be seduced into errors by the
subtle insinuations of men. Continue to love Mahomet,
who honours thee without a fiction.

"Paris, 4th of the 1st Moon of the Year 1644."

In, or about, the year 1645 there was published in
German at Augsburg the <i>Strange Report of a Jew who
claims to have been present at the crucifixion, and to have
been kept alive from that time. A theological warning
to the Christian reader, illustrated and enlarged by trustworthy
histories and examples.</i> On this book there is
a picture representing a village, with trees; on the
right the sun emerging from clouds; in the centre
Jesus crowned with thorns, his arms stretched out; in
front, the Wandering Jew kneeling with clasped
hands, his hat and the Bible lying before him. On
both sides, in horizontal line, runs the sentence:
<i>From Chrysostomo Dudulæo Westphalo, written to his
good friend</i>. On the back are some verses, the first
two lines being in Latin:

/p
"Nubibus in altis crucifixum cemit Jesum
 Asverus, dignum clamitat ante cruce."
p/

In 1681 there appeared a publication, written by
Pastor J. Georg Hadeck: <i>Nathanieli Christiano.
Relation concerning a hermit named Ahasuerus, a Jew
who was present at the crucifixion, etc.</i>

M. Magnin in an essay prefixed to the <i>Ahasuerus</i>
of Edgar Quinet (Paris edition of 1843, p. 24) says
"In 1641 an Austrian baron, and in 1643 a physician
returned from Palestine, related that a certain Turk
had pointed out 'Joseph' to a Venetian nobleman
named Bianchi. The poor Jew was then under close
guard at the bottom of a crypt in Jerusalem; he was
dressed in his ancient Roman costume, exactly that
of the time of Christ. He did nothing but walk about
the room without saying a word, and strike his hand
against the wall, or sometimes his breast, to testify
his sorrow for having struck the holy face of the Lord.
I find these details in an anonymous German work of
the middle of the 17th century, bearing the singular
title of <i>Relation</i>, or <i>Brief account of two living witnesses
of the Passion of our Saviour</i>." This was no
doubt a version of the work of Droscher, <i>De duobus
testibus vivis passionis dominicæ</i>, Jena, 1688. M.
Gaston Paris believes this to have been a tale suggested
by the Matthew Paris Chronicle, printed in
London in 1571, at Zurich in 1586.

An important work appeared with the following title:
<i>Dissertatio historica de Judæo non mortali</i>, etc. <i>Certaminis
publ. argum. f. Præs. Schultz. Regiom. Pruss.
respondens Martin Schmid Slavio. Pomer.</i> <sc>A.D.</sc> <i>26 Jan.
Ann. 1689</i>. This work contains a curious account of
the Twelve Tribes, sent by a Jewish physician to his
co-religionists in Mantua; also a "trustworthy" copy
of the judgment which Pilate pronounced on Christ,
stating his motives, subscribed by all members of his
council and officers of the Sanhedrim; with the full
Notes of the Prosecutor; these having been "found in
a marble rock in the city of Aquila." (This idea was
used by A. W. Schlegel, in his romance on the subject.)

In 1697 a book was published at Wolffenbüttel,
entitled <i>Description of a Hermit, a Jew</i> (etc.), <i>who
brings near the evidence of Joseph concerning Christ;
the history of the death of Christ; the Letter of
Lentulus to the Roman Council; the condemnation of
Christ; history of the broken stone; Letter of Pilate
to the Emperor Tiberias; of Pilate's punishment said
to have been inflicted on the Twelve Tribes of Israel for
the crucifixion of Christ. With an addition concerning
a Jew, a sorcerer, who gave himself out for the Messias.
Collected out of respectable old histories and most trustworthy
testimonies.</i>

In the French language there was published at
Bordeaux (1609) the <i>True History of the Wandering
Jew taken from his own lips</i>. The legend seems hardly
to have been known in Spain, and but little in Italy,
at any early date. There was printed at Bruges
(where the <i>Chronique rimée</i> of Philippe de Mousket
had prepared the soil for it) early in the seventeenth
century (probably) a folkbook entitled <i>Wonderful
History of the Wandering Jew, who since the year 33
to this time has only wandered</i>.

In the English language the only early story of the
Wandering Jew, after that in the Chronicle of
Matthew of Paris, is the ballad contained in <i>Percy's
Reliques</i>. This ballad is in black-letter in the Pepys'
collection; it follows the Hamburg legend, and was
probably written early in the 17th century. That the
legend was well known in England in the seventeenth
century appears from a satire, in which it is utilised,
without being narrated, entitled <i>The Wandering Jew
telling Fortunes to Englishmen. A Jew's Lottery.</i>
<i>London</i>: printed by John Raworth, for Nathaniel
Butter, 1640.

It should also be stated that there were a number
of treatises written against the story, such as--1. <i>De
duobus testibus vivis passionis Christi.</i> <i>Jena</i>, 1668
(written by S. Niemann); 2. <i>Meletea historia de Judæo
immortali</i>, 1668 (written by J. Freutzel); 3. <i>Diss.
hist. de Judæo non mortali</i>, 1689 (written by Martin
Schmid). In the following century (1723) an anonymous
pamphlet was printed, in Frankfort and Leipzig,
"concerning the Immortal Jew, in which it is shown
throughout that in the nature of things he never
existed." In 1756 was published C. Anton's <i>Diss.
in qua lepidam fabulam de Judæo immortali examinet</i>;
followed by <i>An Alewife's letter to Anton, that there
is a Wandering Jew</i>. (Halle, 1756.)

This earlier bibliography of the Wandering Jew is
mainly condensed from the most important work on
the antiquarian features of the legend:--<i>Die Sage vom
Ewigen Juden, historisch entwecklt mit verwandter
Mythen verglichen und beleuchtet</i>. Von Dr. J. G. Th.
Grässe. Dresden u. Leipzig, 1844.

In following Grässe, M. Schœbel (<i>La legende du
Juif Errant</i>, Paris, 1877), and M. Gaston Paris (<i>Le
Juif Errant</i>, Paris, 1880) have added important points
and criticisms.

From the various books mentioned are gathered
the following notes:

S. Grosse (in his "History of Leipzig") says that the
Wandering Jew appeared there as a beggar in 1642,
and accepted gifts, some of high value. Other
traditions report that he refused presents.

It is a tradition of Matterberge, under the
Matterhorn, that formerly a great city stood there;
and it is said that when the Wandering Jew first came
there he said: "When I come again I shall find a forest
where now are houses; and when I come the third time
all will be snow and ice: and this has been fulfilled."

It is said that at Naumburg (Thuringia) he could
neither sit nor stand still. Even when listening to a
sermon he was always moving. He said he had "no
rest by day or night, and was kept alive without food
or drink, sleep or rest, for many years in a miraculous
manner." It is said that, in 1640, two citizens of
Brussels, walking in a wood, met a grey old man, in
shabby and antique garb. They invited him to an inn,
where he drank with them, standing. Before leaving,
he told them of things that happened centuries
before. They gathered that he was Isaac Laquedem,
the Jew who forbade his Lord to rest at his door,
and left him in terror.

The presence in England of a man pretending to
be the Wandering Jew is stated in a letter of Madame
de Mazarin to Madame de Bouillon (Calmet, <i>Dict. de
la Bible</i>, ii. 472). In England he assumed the character
of one who had been an official of high rank in Jerusalem.
His statements to the English noblemen and
University professors who conversed with him (many of
whom believed his story) were so precisely those which
were given to the Turkish Spy in Paris that there is
no need to reproduce them here. It is probable that
the same man had journeyed from Paris to England,
as it is difficult to believe that two such clever and
learned impostors could appear at the same time.

It is notable that an account of the first appearance
of a personal representative of the legend should
only have been published more than fifty years (certainly)
after his visit to Hamburg; and then just after
the death of the witness said to have conversed with
him, Paul of Eizen. This prelate was born at Hamburg,
1522, and died in 1598. His alleged testimonies
to the Wandering Jew were reported subsequently by
the pseudonymous Duduläus. It is further remarkable
that in the story as told by Duduläus, already
given, nothing is said of a <i>blow</i> dealt Jesus by
Ahasuerus. He evidently desires to soften the story
for the Wandering Jew, and adduce him as a witness
to the Christian legend. He tries in one of his pamphlets
to recommend the story to sceptics by relating
another of three pious miners of Bohemia, who fell
into a pit at Kuttenberg. They remained there for
seven years, their provisions and lamp holding out
miraculously. One prayed that he might again see
the light of day; another, that he might once more
eat with his family; the third, that he might live one
more year with his wife and children. The prayers
were answered, but each died suddenly immediately
after his wish was fulfilled.

The <i>animus</i> of the revival of the legend is shown by instances
in which the Jews' quarters were invaded under
rumours that they were concealing the Wanderer.




II.

THE UNDYING ONES.


The myth of the Wandering Jew belongs, essentially,
to a class which has great antiquity, and is found in
every part of the world.

At a period before Animism had been embodied
in clear conceptions of a life beyond the grave, the
human heart and mind had to adapt themselves as
well as they could to the King of Terrors, which
destroyed the greatest as well as the humblest. The
first that were ideally wrested from Death were
saints and heroes; and it was necessary to find for
these an earthly immortality. Many myths and
legends of the undying ones are no doubt variants of
each other; but they are found among races so separate
in origin and history, that we may be content to
find their common root in human nature. Men
cannot bear to think that their leaders, heroes,
saviours are really dead. They resolutely repel the
unwelcome fact as long as they can. They easily
credit any rumour that the reported death is some
fiction of the enemy, or possibly a stratagem of their
own party-leaders. It is said that after the death of
General Jackson, a President of the United States,
many democrats still voted for him at the following
election, denouncing the report of his death as
"another Whig lie." The story if not true is <i>ben
trovato</i>; and there are facts enough like it even in
modern history. Sceptics were found in France who
but slowly credited the tidings of the death of Napoleon
III.: their transient suspicions were echoes of
Beranger's cry when he heard of the first Napoleon's
death: "God, I can scarce believe Thee without
him!"[1]

[Footnote 1: Some excellent remarks on this subject, and historical
illustrations, are contained in an article in the late <i>Theological
Review</i> (July, 1871) on the "Nero Saga," by W. M. W. Call.]

It is recorded in the <i>Heimskringla</i> that, after the
death of King Odin, "the Swedes believed that he
often showed himself to them before any great battle.
To some he gave victory, others he invited to himself;
and they reckoned both of these to be well off
in their fate." Thus, the Wild Huntsman began his
career. This tendency in the popular mind was
utilised by courtiers of the next popular monarch.
This was Freyr, second monarch after Odin, who
probably lived in the first century of our era, and
built the great temple at Upsal. It is recorded:
"Then began, in his days, the Frode-peace; and then
there were good seasons in all the land, which the
Swedes ascribed to Freyr, so that he was more
worshipped than the other gods, as the people became
much richer in his days by reason of the peace and
good seasons.... Freyr fell into a sickness; and
as his illness took the upper hand, his men took the
plan of letting few approach him. In the meantime
they raised a great mound, in which they placed a
door with three holes in it. Now when Freyr died
they bore him secretly into the mound, but told the
Swedes he was alive; and they kept watch over him
for three years. They brought all the taxes into the
mound; and through the one hole they put in the
gold, through the other the silver, and through the
third the copper money that was paid. Peace and
good seasons prevailed.... When it became known
to the Swedes that Freyr was dead, and yet peace
and good seasons continued, they believed that it
must be so as long as Freyr remained in Sweden;
and therefore they would not burn his remains, but
called him the god of this world, and afterwards
offered continually blood sacrifices to him, principally
for peace and good seasons."[2] Here we have one
chapter in the genesis of these immortals. Men have
been executed in Portugal for professing to be
Sebastian returned. In the time of James II.,
country-people in England believed that Monmouth
had not really died on the scaffold, but "would suddenly
appear, would lead them on to victory, and would
tread down the King and the Jesuits under his feet."[3]
Some believed him to be the Man in the Iron Mask.

[Footnote 2: The <i>Heimskringla</i>. Translated by Samuel Laing. Longmans,
1844. Vol. i., p. 225.]

[Footnote 3: Macaulay's "History of England," ch. viii. Fourth edition.]

On the death of King Arthur all hope of finding
the Holy Graal seemed to vanish. On the
"Morte d'Arthur" it is written: "This of King
Arthur, I find no more written in my copy of the
certainty of his death; but thus he was led away in
a barge, wherein were three Queens; and one was
King Arthur's sister, Queen Morgan le Fay, and
there was Nimue, the chief Lady of the Lake. More
of the death of King Arthur, could I never find. But
that ladies brought such a one unto burials, that he
was buried here, that the hermit bare witness that
sometime was Bishop of Canterbury and dwelled that
time in a chapel beside Glastonbury. But yet the
hermit knew not, of a certain, that it was verily the
body of King Arthur. Some men yet say in many
parts of England that King Arthur is not dead, but
had, by the will of our Lord Jesus Christ, into
another place. And men say that he will come
again, and he shall win the Holy Cross."[4] That
King Arthur is in the Vale of Avalon (of Apples)
attended by fairies; that in some regions he has been
found by shepherds slumbering, like Barbarossa, with
his knights in a subterranean castle (at Sewingshields
especially); that in others he has been seen, like
Wodan, at the head of a ghostly hunt by night:
these are legends found far and wide in British and
Breton folklore. Tennyson makes Arthur repose in--

[Footnote 4: "La Morte d'Arthur." Compiled by Sir Thomas Mallory
(Conybeare's edition). Moxon, 1868, p. 404. The Cornish
legend was that Arthur would return to drive the Saxons from
Britain. Similar stories are told of Sir Gawaine, Ogier, and
others.]

/p
"The island-valley of Avilion
 Where falls not hail, nor rain, nor any snow,
 Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies
 Deep-meadowed, happy, fair, with orchard lawns,
 And bowery hollows crowned with summer sea."
p/

Germany has many corresponding myths, chief of
which is that of Frederick I., or Barbarossa, believed
to be sleeping under Raven's Hill at Kaiserlautern,
ready to come forth in the last emergency (or glory
and unity) of his country. There, in his palace (or
grotto) underground, a shepherd once found him surrounded
by his sleeping knights, all in armour; the
horses near by in harness. The red beard, which gave
the hero his name, had grown through the stone table
before him, and taken root in the floor. As the shepherd
entered, Barbarossa awoke and asked:

"Are the ravens still flying round the hill?"

"Yes."

"Then must I sleep another hundred years."

On the evening when the present Emperor of Germany
had reviewed his troops, after his late war with
France, this legend was represented before him in a
series of marvellous tableaux which I witnessed. In
the last it was shown that the hour had arrived for
Frederick the Red Beard to come forth, and it need
hardly be said that he bore a striking resemblance to
the Emperor William. In some regions it is said that
Frau Holda stands beside the slumbering Barbarossa:
this may have helped to give us our familiar variant
<i>The Sleeping Beauty</i>.

It is said that after Pope Paschal III. had made
Charlemagne a saint, Otho III. (anno 997) opened
that Emperor's tomb and found him seated on his
throne, with his crown, imperial robe, and sceptre,
and on his knees a copy of the Gospels. Beside
him was his sword Joyeuse, and his pilgrim's pouch.
So Charlemagne was added to the list of holy
sleepers.

In another work I have spoken of these Sleepers,
and also of the Wanderers.[5] The list of such, too long
to be given here, includes Tell, in Switzerland; Boabdil
of Spain; Sebastian of Portugal; Olger Dansk;
Thomas of Ercildoune, and many another, down to
such præternatural if not perpetual sleepers as Rip
Van Winkle, and the Abbot Cormac of Killarney,
who listened two hundred years to the singing of a
nightingale. The Abbot had doubted if he would
not find the singing of heaven tiresome; he supposed
he had listened to the bird a few moments only in
the wood, but returned to find all changed. The
legend has inspired one of Allingham's beautiful
ballads, "The Abbot of Inisfalen." Herodotus (iv. 94)
relates the tale of Zalmoxis, the Thracian, who, disgusted
with the uncivilised life around him, had a subterranean
hall built and there resided. Some presently
believed that Zalmoxis never died; others regarded him
as a god; and ultimately it became a custom of the
Getans to despatch a messenger, every fifth year, to
him, by hurling some man into the air and catching
him on javelins. If the victim dies Zalmoxis is propitious.
Plutarch relates a story similar to this (De
Defect. Orac.), as told by one Cleombrotus, concerning
an Oriental personage who appeared among his
fellow-men only once a year. The rest of his life was
passed among friendly nymphs and demons, and as
these are said to have rendered him proof against
disease it may be supposed that he was one of the
undying.

[Footnote 5: "Demonology and Devil-lore." (Index.) See Sir G. W.
Cox, "Mythology of the Aryan Nations." Keightley, "Fairy
Mythology," i. 74, <i>sq.</i> Folk-lore Record, ii. 1, <i>sq.</i>]

Similar legends are indeed found among the
aboriginal races of North America. Such heroes as
Booin (Nova Scotia) and Hiawatha were supposed
never to have died. Booin was carried to a happy
land inside a friendly whale, whom he compensated
with the tobacco which the Micmacs still see smoking
in the spout of that animal; and Hiawatha "sailed
into the purple sunset." To these good Indians
migrate when they die. The Incas of Peru also
were found believing that the founder of their
kingdom never died, but would return to restore its
ancient splendours. The Muyscas of Bogota relate
that the first lawgiver of Bochica lived among their
tribe 2000 years, then "withdrew," and he is now
known as Idacanzas.[6]

[Footnote 6: Tylor, <i>Primitive Culture</i>, i. 318.]

It is interesting to compare such primitive forms of
the myth with those assumed by it amid the advanced
phases of Animism. Tithonus, for whom Eos obtained
the gift of immortality but not that of perpetual
youth, whom divine pity changed into a grasshopper,
became the proverbial title of a decrepit old
man, and represents the nearest approach to an
earthly immortal in Greek mythology. The immortals
exist indeed, but in changed forms, or even if the
human powers be preserved it must be in Hades, as
in the case of Teiresias. The Glaucus-myth, running
through several variants, shows the evolution of this
class of myths. Surviving all ordeals in Crete--the
sea, the cask of honey, the serpent's bite--he
becomes on the Corinthian coast an evil ghost, and
in Bœotia a marine deity. In classic ages every
hero has his vulnerable point where he is sure to be
touched at last.




III.

SOURCES OF THE MYTH.


Although, as we have seen, the myths of the
undying ones are found among races so widely
separate that they must often be of independent
origin, many of them are ethnically related. This is
the case with a series of such, now to be considered,
which bear upon the fable of the Wandering Jew.

The earliest myth of this character is probably
that of the Iranian Yima, King of the Golden Age in
Persia. This beautiful myth is found in the Zendavesta,
and in the Vendidad which Haug traces, in
its earlier parts, to an antiquity not far short of
Zoroaster himself, not less than a thousand years
before our era. In the Zendavesta it is declared:
"During the happy reign of Yima there was neither
cold nor heat, neither decay nor death, nor malice
produced by the demons; father and son walked
forth, each fifteen years old in appearance." With
Yima was Armaiti, the divine woman, genius of the
earth, who by promoting culture, recovering wildernesses
and converting nomadic tribes to peaceful
cultivators, expanded the earth to thrice its original
size; and over this paradise Yima reigned nine
hundred years. After the evils of winter had come
over his country Yima led a select number of his
friends to a secluded spot, where they enjoy perfect
happiness.[7] Armaiti still, in Parsî faith, remained at
her work, upholding the earth in her maternal arms,
ever working against the powers of evil; and when
she shall have prevailed, Yima is to come back again
and lead in the Golden Year.

[Footnote 7: Haug's Essays, etc., p. 277.]

It is an instance of the unconscious poetry of
humanity that this Iranian Yima is one with Yama,
the Vedic King of the Dead! The idea may have
originally been the declining sun;[8] but there are
other characters than darkness about the sunset;
there are splendours also, and often the western
horizon is painted with radiant islets which to
primitive man seemed a part of his planet. It may
even have been that the westward course of human
migration was guided by this permanent pillar of
Fire which every evening lit up the Hesperian
Gardens and Isles of the Blest.

[Footnote 8: Max Müller's <i>Science of Language</i>, vol. ii. p. 563.]

This migration on earth and sea corresponds with
a mental and spiritual migration. Exploration of
the Edens, Gan-Edens, Avalons, Hesperides, Atlantises,
turns them to parts of the prosaic world
while it raises the ideals that hovered over them to
rosy cloud-lands which cannot yet be explored.
No Yima found anywhere on earth! And so
it begins to be sung of him that he has passed
to some region not exactly upon earth. Now
it is said, this time in the Rigveda (x. 14, 1, 2):
"Yama, the king, the gatherer of the people, has
descried a path for many, which leads from the
depths to the heights; he first found out a resting-place
from which nobody can turn out the occupants;
on the way the forefathers have gone, the sons will
follow them." Finally, as Haug remarks: "This
happy ruler of the blessed in Paradise has been
transformed, in the modern Hindu mythology, into
the fearful god of death, the inexorable judge of
men's doings, and the punisher of the wicked."

For a long time after their constitution as a people,
the Jews had no definite faith in the immortality of
the soul, and there is no text in the Old Testament
which clearly teaches that doctrine. It has been
thought by some that their adoption of that doctrine
was coincident with their decline from greatness as a
nation.[9] Jehovah still walked amid the pleasant
shade-trees of Paradise, and there Enoch walked with
him. Out of this belief in an earthly immortality
grew the earlier form of belief in the life after death,
which insisted on corporeal resurrection. As time
went on, and the numbers for whom immortality
was claimed grew, and as exploration discovered no
earthly Eden in which these resided, paradise necessarily
ascended to an aerial realm. But its earthly
characteristics were preserved. Thence angels passed
to earth and back on a ladder, and thence came the
chariot and horses which appeared when Elias was
borne away by a sufficiently strong whirlwind. That
he was 'carried to the sky' marks, however, a step
away from the earthly abode, in the direction taken
by the myth which turned Yima to Yama.

[Footnote 9: See the statement by one of the interlocutors in Dr. Kalisch's
admirable work <i>Path and Goal</i>, p. 348. (Longmans, 1880.)]

But the Jews introduced into their belief in certain
undying ones an important feature, drawn from their
imported dualistic philosophy, which marshalled
everything and every being, small or large, on one
side or the other of the great war between Ormuzd
and Ahriman. Beside the hero, too holy to die, is
seen the man of sin, to whom the repose of the grave
is forbidden. The books of our Bible were written
after ancient traditions, and gathered together when
other ideas were predominant; and it is rather by
intimations there found, and by references to rabbinical
and Arabian folk-lore, that we can get at these
primitive fables.

In the first epoch we find counterparts in Cain and
Seth. Even the Biblical narrative seems to point to
a primitive myth, in which these two were good and
evil immortals, which had gone to pieces before the
book of Genesis was compiled.[10] At any rate at an
early age the pieces had been put together by the
Semitic imagination. It is said (Gen. iv. 25) that Eve
called this her third son Seth (<i>scion</i> or <i>germ</i>): "for,"
she said, "God hath appointed me another seed in
place of Abel, whom Cain slew." The Talmudic book,
<i>Shene Luchôth</i>, says that the soul of Abel (<i>breath</i>)
passed into Seth, and again into Moses. Josephus
(<i>Ant.</i> i. 2) shows that Seth was venerated as one
possessed of great knowledge, which he engraved on
two pillars. Suidas says Seth was the first to hear
the name of God. In the fourth century there was a
sect of Sethians, who, according to Epiphanius, identified
Seth with the Messiah (Adv. Hær. i. 3, 39). In
the line of Seth were born the long-lived beings, some
of whom lived above nine hundred years, and one of
whom was Enoch, who did not die at all. Many of the
names resemble those in the line of Cain--and were
no doubt taken from it--Cain-an, Mahalaleel, Jared,
Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech. It is evident that the
Seth legend was introduced to avoid having the
human race descend from the first murderer and type
of evil--Cain.

[Footnote 10: See Ewald's <i>Geschichte des Volkes Israel</i>, i. 353 (Russell
Martineau's Translation, p. 264, <i>sq.</i>). For traditions concerning
Seth, see also my <i>Demonology and Devil-lore</i>, as per Index.]

Cain was the first Wandering Jew. His name,
signifying a spear, and Tubal-Cain, "son of a spear,"
first artificer in brass and iron, suggest the possibility
that his doom may have been that of a Semitic Prometheus.
At any rate the curse pronounced upon
him ("a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the
earth"); the mark (token, or perhaps <i>weird</i>) fixed
upon him, that none should slay him; the land to
which he wandered, itself meaning flight (Nod)--supplied
ample materials for the mother-myth of eternal
Wanderers. Of Cain, however, more will be said at a
further stage of our inquiry.

Enoch represents the first personage of Biblical
record clearly corresponding to Yima. "Enoch
walked with Elohim and was no more [seen among
men], for Elohim took him." With regard to the
solar character of the Enoch-myth we cannot concern
ourselves here. As his name indicates Enoch is the
Beginner, like Yima, of whom Ahuramazda says, "with
him I conversed first among men" (Vendidad, ii. 2).
It is especially noticeable that Enoch "walks" with
Elohim, whom we before find "walking in the garden"
(Gen. iii. 8). A heavenly abode is not yet imagined.
Even the Koran, when it speaks of Enoch (Erdris),
hesitates to affirm his translation to heaven, but says,
"We exalted him to a high place."

The evil counterpart of Enoch is Lamech, who,
although his death at the age of 777 is recorded in the
later Sethite line, identifies himself as a deathless
wanderer with Cain in the lines which, as Ewald
thinks, probably gave rise to the Cain story
itself:

/p
Adah and Zillah, hear my voice!
  Ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech!
For the man I slew for my own wound,
  The child I struck dead on account of my own hurt!
Was Cain avenged seven times?
  Lamech will be seven and seventy times!
p/

In the third epoch we find Esau a restless evil
wanderer, fulfilling the destiny pronounced by his
father, gradually personifying Edom, the antagonist
of Israel. The corresponding immortal is Judah,
from whose hand the sceptre was not to depart till
Shiloh come. The death of neither of these is mentioned;
Edom and Judah remained to carry on their
phantasmal war to the last--as Satan and Jahve, as
Sammaël and Michael.

The mysterious account, in Deut. xxxiv., of the
death of Moses, suggests the existence at some period
of a popular belief that he did not die in the ordinary
sense. It is said, by one rendering, that he died "on
the mouth of Jahve"; "his eye was not dim nor his
natural strength abated"; Jahve knew him "face to
face," and himself buried him in a valley, in a place
unknown to this day. According to the Talmud,
Enoch, Moses, and Elias, are brought up by Michael
to be changed into angels. (Kalisch, Comm. on O. T.,
II. p. 307.) This association of Moses with the two
who notoriously had not died is significant. In the
Book of "The Assumption of Moses" the demon who
tried to get the body of Moses, as mentioned in Jude
ix., is called Sammaël. This had long been the name
for Esau-Edom; and there is also in this coincidence
the intimation of an early legend which brought Moses
slumbering in his Moabite cave into mythological
relation with restless Esau, ever wandering amid the
dark mountains. The presence of Moses at the transfiguration
of Jesus in company with Elias, who never
died, would alone show that belief in his earthly immortality
had prevailed. In addition, there are intimations
of such a tradition among the Arabs. The Moslems
make pilgrimages to Neby Musa, near Jericho, as the
sepulchre of Moses, and their legend is as follows:
God had promised to leave Moses in this world until
he should voluntarily descend into a tomb. After
Moses had lived 120 years, he was one day walking
and saw four men (angels) excavating a chamber in a
rock, as, they said, a hiding-place for their king's most
precious treasure. The cavern offered a tempting
retreat from the sun's rays, and Moses reclined in it.
One of the workmen gave him a delicious apple. No
sooner had he inhaled its scent than "he fell
asleep."[11]

[Footnote 11: Pierotti; <i>Customs and Traditions of Palestine</i>.]

An evil counterpart of Moses may be found in the
tradition--very important to the legend of the
Wandering Jew, as we shall presently see--that the
maker of the Golden Calf was doomed to a fate much
like that of Cain. There arose a proverb among the
Jews that "no punishment befalleth the Israelites in
which there is not an ounce of this calf." Although
in the Bible the fashioning of this idol is distinctly
ascribed to Aaron, he was not among the three
thousand slain on account of it, but was pardoned.
Moses says, "The Lord was very angry with Aaron to
have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron at the
same time" (Deut. ix. 20). Semitic Folk-lore has been
still more merciful to Aaron's reputation, at cost of
the Samaritans, and made it out that the Golden Calf
was fashioned by one Samiri, or Al Sâmeri. "The
devil," says Jonathan, "got into the metal and
fashioned it into a calf." The Koran says the calf
lowed, and in Arabian tradition Al Sâmeri took some
dust from the footsteps of the horse of Gabriel, who
rode at the head of Israel, and threw it in the calf's
mouth, which began to low.

Now, many of the Samaritans themselves, about the
first century of our era, gathered about one Dositheus
as their Messiah (Origen, <i>De Princ</i>. iv. c. 17; Epiphanius,
<i>Hæres</i>. xiii.). His pretensions brought upon
Dositheus an order for his arrest from the Samaritan
high-priest, from which he escaped and hid in a cave.
There, according to some, he starved to death; but
his followers continued to believe that he was alive
and would reappear. It is possible that Al Sâmeri
means "the Samaritan"--<i>i.e.</i> Dositheus or Dûsis--and
that he thus became the mythical scapegoat for
Aaron's offence. G. Weil (<i>The Bible, the Koran, and
the Talmud</i>) says: "Moses then summoned Samiri,
and would have put him to death instantly, but Allah
directed that he should be sent into banishment.
Ever since that time he roams like a wild beast
throughout the world; everyone shuns him and purifies
the ground on which his feet have stood; and he
himself, whenever he approaches men, exclaims:
'Touch me not!'"

In the Koran (Sale, xx.) it is declared that Moses
said to Al Sâmeri, "Get thee gone; for thy punishment
in this life shall be that thou shalt say unto
those who shall meet thee, Touch me not!" Al
Beidâwi is quoted by Sale as interpreting this to mean
that infection would follow the touch, but to Al
Sâmeri; ultimately, however, the fear was on the other
side. It was believed that Al Sâmeri repaired to an
island in the Red Sea, where his wretched descendants
dwell, and whence issue plagues. Whenever a ship
comes near the inhabitants raise the warning cry,
"Touch me not!"

Al Beidâwi also says that Al Sâmeri's real name
was Moses, or Mûsa Ebn Dhafar, which seems to
suggest that he was regarded as the counterpart of
Moses; and also as a source of pestilence he would be
the opposite of Moses, whose medical skill was
famous.

Although it may anticipate somewhat the later
developments of our myth, it may be well to suggest
here the probability that the traditional idea, preserved
in the romance of Eugene Sue and elsewhere,
that the Wandering Jew carried the plague from city
to city, may have been connected with this legendary
Red Sea Island. Its real origin may have been in
the actual diseases bred in the wretched quarters in
which Jews were crowded by a suicidal inhumanity, and
from which every Jewish traveller and trader had to go.

The next undying one is Elias. The idea of
Jahve's earthly abode had grown dim, at least, and
Eden had begun to ascend amid the roseate clouds
when this legend was formed. The terrestrial chariot
and horses are present, but a whirlwind is needed to
carry them with the prophet to heaven. The narrative
seems meant to admit of either theory--a heavenly
or an earthly paradise. There Elias remained as a
kind of Æolus, literally as on earth a weather-prophet;
and to this day in Greece, and many parts of
the East, when a severe storm with lightning arises,
the peasants say, "Elias goes forth in his chariot!"[12]

[Footnote 12: When the abyss between biblical and other mythology has
ceased to be so convenient, perhaps there may be traced some
connection between the ravens that fed Elias and those birds
of Odin that circle around Raven's Hill where Barbarossa sleeps;
and also between Elias and our folk-tales of Æolus.]

In folk-lore Elias unites in himself characteristics
both of the Sleepers and Wanderers. In some regions
he is supposed to have employed his leisure in paradise
with writing a book. In Moslem legend he is a
Wanderer. A powerful sheikh, they say, wished to
utilise the miraculous gifts of Elias, and had him
chained. The tyrant led him over his lands because
his "footsteps were blessed," but at the prophet's every
step the fields withered. The sheikh was about to
slay Elias, when the prophet asked permission to
quench his thirst at what is now called the "sealed
fountain," near Bethlehem. The tyrant held the chain
which, however, elongated itself: the bonds fell off,
the rock closed behind him, and since then Elias "has
continued to travel over the whole world, rendering
every place verdant on which he treads." The
"sealed fountain" of the rains, which only Elias could
unseal in the time of drouth, would appear in this
myth to feel its relation with the Sun. One need not
wonder that Dr. Schliemann found a Greek church
consecrated to Elias on the site of a temple of
Helios.[13]

[Footnote 13: It would be an interesting question, but one that cannot be
discussed here, to consider how far the idea of eternal Wanderers
may have been primarily connected with the ever-returning
heavenly bodies. Ewald and Goldziher agree that the years
of Enoch's visible life, 365, indicate the solar year. Ewald
thinks he was probably a god of the New Year.]

The Dualism which in the Semitic Mythology divided
the undying ones into good and evil, is generally
found in the corresponding traditions of other regions.
We find good and evil counterparts in Barbarossa and
Wodan; in the Wild Huntsman, and faithful Eckhardt
who warns of his approach; in King Arthur wandering
as a raven, contrasted with Merlin, bound for
ever in his prison of air by the spell of Vivien; in
the German Monk Felix (who, like Abbot Cormac,
listened for centuries to the singing bird, W. Grimm,
<i>Altdeutsche Walder</i>, ii. 70), with King Herla, who
was similarly bewitched by the evil dwarf to whose
wedding he went; in Siegfried, with Van der Decken,
who swore his ship should round the Cape, "despite
God or Devil, if it took till judgment," and is now
the Flying Dutchman; in Tannhäuser, with Lohengrin;
in Ogier among the fairies of Morgana, with
the Gros Veneur; in the Seven Sleepers of Tours,
with Hugo wandering beside their grotto.




IV.

THE LEGENDS GENERALISED.


If we examine well the account in the Zendavesta
of the paradise wherein Yima walked with Ahuramazda,
and that in Genesis of Eden where Enoch
walked with Elohim, we can hardly fail to recognise
in them the germ of the Messianic dream. The
visions of the renovated earth described by Philo,
and in the Sibylline Oracles, and in the Apocalypse
of Baruch, are but realistic expansions of those
happy retreats of the holy ones who were not supposed
to taste corruption.[14] In this idealised earth
were gathered the beauties and joys of many
Gulistans.

[Footnote 14: See Professor Drummond's "The Jewish Messiah," etc.
In Haug's <i>Essays</i> will be found a full account of Yima and his
earthly paradise.]

And, similarly, he who was to reign over the imparadised
in this perfected earth was to be an immortal
king returning from his Avalon, invested with
the attributes of all the incorruptible. These had
been gradually raised into an abstract personality--the
"Angel-Messiah," to which Mr. Ernest de Bunsen
has given such patient research with many interesting
results--who, however, was purely a terrestrial being,
a Son of Man.

The phrase "Ancient of Days," used three times in
Daniel vii., and the snow-white hair there ascribed to
that being, who gives dominion to the Son of Man
brought before him, convey the idea of a being that
has lived through all changes, a memory and consciousness
in which the ages broken up to mortal eyes are
knit together, and therefore able to be a providence
and a retributive judge. Viceroy of this Ancient of
Days is the immortal man in whose unbroken consciousness
all history is embodied: he is the earthly
providence. Before Abraham was, he is. He abides
with the Ancient in his earthly dwelling, but goes
forth at appointed periods for certain purposes. He
is the "Son of Man" as distinguished from the sons
of Kings; reigns not by succession but by election of
the Deity manifested in signs and marvels, such as the
carrier dove bringing the divine sanction to emperors
who break the order of legitimacy. No incarnation
was imagined; the avatars of this Son of Man are the
Apparitions of one always in the earth, but able to
render himself invisible, or who assumes an humble disguise.
This disguise may be thrown off occasionally
in some solitary place, for a select few who are charged
with secresy.

This Messiah gathered up in his person the powers
and glories of past saints and heroes, and it was expected
that these would attend him at the supreme scene of
his coronation on earth. Elias was to appear as his
herald. In Seder 'Olam Rabbah it is said, "In the
second year of the reign of Ahaziah, Elias became
hidden, [to be] seen no more until King Messiah shall
come, when he will be again seen, and hidden a
second time, and not seen again until Gog and Magog
come. And now he writes down the work of all the
generations." It was asked of John the Baptist "Art
thou Elias?" and next "Art thou that prophet?"
Who was this prophet popularly thus associated with
Messianic expectations? Professor Drummond suggests
that it was Jeremiah, and cites the vision of
Judas Maccabæus, in which he saw, beside Onias the
high-priest, "a man with grey hairs and exceeding
glorious," who was declared to be Jeremiah, "who
offers many prayers for the people and the holy city."
Jeremiah gave Judas a golden sword, and told him to
wound the adversaries.

On the nether side of this Messianic dream we find
a pit or underworld--some region which could not
mar the fair face of the perfect earth--which is an
outcome of the wilderness of Dendain, Cain's Land,
every weird desolation. And the king of this region
sums up in himself the line of eternal evil wanderers--Cain,
Lamech, Esau, Samuel--in a personification
of hostility to the Messiah. This generalised Opposition--called
Armillus among the Jews, Al Dajjail
by the Mussulmans--corresponds exactly with
Antichrist among the early Christians. It was said
Armillus was to be born out of a marble statue in a
church at Rome (the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of earthly infernalism
to a race detesting graven images and victimised
by Rome), and that Christendom would
worship him until the true Messias (Ben David)
should appear, and, as says the Targum (Isa. xi. 4)
"By the word of his mouth the wicked Armillus shall
die."




V.

TRANSFIGURATION.


Though the alleged longevity of the Jewish patriarchs
temporarily made up for the absence of the
conception of immortality, this idea arrived. The
representatives of Seth live above an average of
nine centuries each, with one remarkable exception:
Enoch, the best of them, lives less than half
the years of the least. Whatever may have been
the original reason for this exception, the explanation
was that Enoch really outstripped even the
969 years of Methuselah, having never died at
all. In paradise he would have access to the Tree
of Life. In the farther development of Israel other
"beginners"--as Moses representing Law, and Elias
Prophecy--might eclipse Enoch, and wear "by
authority" his mantle of immortality; but in popular
faith and folk-lore Enoch held his own. He was said
to have invented writing, arithmetic, and astronomy;
to have filled 300 volumes with the knowledge acquired
by long residence among the angels; his first being a
book predicting the Deluge, which was preserved by
Noah in the Ark. In many respects Enoch resembles
Teiresias, to whom Zeus granted a life on earth of
seven or nine generations, and who even in Hades
was said by Homer to have retained his human
perception, while those around him were mere shades
(Plato, Meno, 100).[15] His fame as a soothsayer, both
on earth and in Hades, grew out of the belief in his
long experience, and no doubt this was the case with
Enoch also. Most folk-sayings and predictions were
connected with Enoch as forged runes and verses
are now attributed to Mother Shipton. (It will be
remembered that the first English book on this theme
was entitled <i>The Wandering Jew telling fortunes to
Englishmen</i>, 1640.) It might have been supposed
that Enoch would be present at the Transfiguration
of Jesus. Paul had spoken of him with honour;
Jude quoted from him; and it is probable that he
was meant as one of the "two witnesses" alluded
to in Rev. xi. 3. In the Gospel of Nicodemus the
"two witnesses" are Enoch and Elias, who welcome
those arriving in Paradise.

[Footnote 15: The blindness ascribed to Teiresias presents a curious
coincidence with that attributed to Lamech in Legendary Art,
which leads to his accidentally killing Cain with an arrow. In
both cases the significance probably is that of one who is blind
to immediate consequences while seeing or carrying out the
decrees of Fate.]

That Moses was substituted for Elias at the Transfiguration
was probably due to the strong hold which
the "Book of Enoch" had taken on the Jewish mind.
In this work there are indications that among some
Jews Enoch himself had become connected with the
Messianic hope. The writer, personating Enoch and
speaking in his name, describes his journey through
heaven and hell; thus, in the second century <sc>B.C.</sc>
anticipating the journeys and visions of Lucian,
Mohammed, Arda Viráf, Dante, and Swedenborg.
He is attended by an angel, and he is named and
appointed the Son of Man. "That angel came to
me, and with his voice greeted me and said, Thou art
the Son of Man who is born to righteousness; and
righteousness dwells over thee, and the righteousness
of the Head of Days leaves thee not." That a claim
for Enoch's Messiaship is intended appears in the
event then described. Enoch's body melts away, and
his spirit is transformed into a heavenly body. Enoch
had described the glory of the renovated earth; but
he himself, assuming him alive, would be some 2000
years old. No legend said he had been endowed with
perpetual youth; consequently to reign over a rejuvenated
earth he must be rejuvenated himself. Such
a notion could only, at that time, have survived among
the ignorant; but it is to them that new "schools"
have to make their appeal, and in the transfiguration
of Enoch the old idea, though spiritualised, is regarded.

The phrase of the <i>Book of Enoch</i>, "Head of Days,"
is a remarkable modification of Daniel's "Ancient of
Days." It almost looks as if,--assuming Ewald's
theory that Enoch (Beginner) was a god of the New
Year,--this earliest of the immortals were still invested
with more than patriarchal sanctity. As a Janus
or Ganêça (with whom Ewald compares him) Enoch
would himself be the Head of Days, thus as it were
the Ancient of Days dialed on time. The idea of co-eternal
existence is suggested, but also of an Unchangeable
and a Changeable.

It must be remembered that we are considering
ideas which, however poetical, are based on fancies
of the world's childhood. The transformation of
Enoch under the angel's spell belongs to the same
class as the transformations which Yuletide evokes
for the delight of the young from our own German
Mythology, in which deforming spells are broken,
handsome princes step forth from bears or dwarfs,
decrepit crones become fair maidens, and Cinderellas
rise from their ashes and rags in shining raiment and
beauty.

When the Jewish legends were transferred to the
Gentile world this incident (of transfiguration) was
detached from the patriarch and connected with the
generalised type of Israel which represented the
popularisation of its faith among other races.
Probably the Transfiguration, concerning which
secrecy was demanded, was first whispered about
in the Jewish quarters of Rome. In the New Testament
narrative the Transfiguration comes as a
tableau at the end of a conversation immediately
bearing upon the subject of the undying ones.
After being told, in answer to his question, that
some thought he was John the Baptist (in whose
death probably his followers refused to believe),
others thought him Elias, others Jeremiah, Jesus
asked, "But whom say ye that I am?" Peter said,
"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."
This was the Christian equivalent of the address of
the Angel to Enoch, quoted above. Jesus then assumes
the Messiaship; founds his church, declares
his future course and office, and ends by transferring
to the patriarchs of the new kingdom the mantle of
earthly immortality worn by the Jewish patriarchs.
"Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here
which shall not taste of death till they see the Son of
Man coming in his kingdom." The next thing related
is the Transfiguration. "His face did shine as the
sun, and his raiment was white as the light." Luke
says, "The fashion of his countenance was altered,
and his face was white and glistering." Beside him
are Moses and Elias, whose office as surviving witnesses
is falling upon their successors--James (here the
brother of Jesus), who was miraculously supported
without food from the crucifixion until after the
resurrection, and after death rose again for an important
legendary career; and John, who was to
"tarry" till Christ should come.[16] Peter could only
survive by proxy: it would have been inconvenient to
have him often interfering with the arrangements of
his successor, as in the one case of his reappearance,
when he supplanted a Bishop in consecrating the first
Abbot of Westminster, leaving the Deans thereof
perilously independent ever since. As Enoch was
omitted from the scene because he was a rival Messiah,
Peter received no mantle of immortality because he
might become an invisible rival Vicar.

[Footnote 16: Mrs. Jameson (<i>Sacred and Legendary Art</i>, i., 208) has
given fully the legend of St. James. In the year 936 he appeared
to King Ramirez in Spain promising him a victory over the
Moors, and, on the following day, he (St. James) appeared at
the head of the army on a milk-white horse, when sixty thousand
Moors were slain; hence the Spanish war-cry "Santiago."]

The transfigured representative of the "Head of
Days" was there, but not the transfigured world.
The event was as a rehearsal; the actual performance
had to be postponed for a thousand years. The
hopes of those who had expected to see the thorn-crown
changed to a coronet and the crucified Jew
appearing, resplendent with the aureole of Moses and
the chariot of Elias, to enter on his kingdom, faded
away. It was replaced by the rumours that Jesus
and a few chosen friends were invisibly moving near,
and would befriend the faithful unto the millennial
hour. Then they should all awaken from what, for
believers who had eaten the vitalising body and
blood of Christ, would be but a sleep.

Animistic philosophy in the second century was
such as to admit of the transient death of a Messiah
provided his body was not supposed to be left long
enough under ground to taste corruption. The
Psalm (xvi. 10) said, "Thou wilt not suffer thy holy
one to see corruption;" but, as in the case of Alcestis,
a human being might live again if wrested from death
by the third day. In the case of Lazarus the miracle
consisted in the recovery of life after the body had
been buried four days. The resurrection of Christ, so
far from being a proof of human immortality, manifestly
means that Jesus did not die in the ordinary
sense, but recovered in the sepulchre the ghost he had
breathed out on the cross. In theological statement
he might be thought of as dwelling in heaven; but
for a long time his ascension into heaven was as
much an excursion as his descent into hell; in both
he but went through the <i>rôle</i> of Enoch, and in
Christian folk-tales he was still "always with them,"
moving near, as when he met Peter near Rome, where
his foot-prints are still worshipped.[17]

[Footnote 17: The sacred footprints of Christ are also pointed out on the
Mount of Olives, and at Poitiers, Arles, Fécamp, Rheims, and
Soissons.]

That which was Job's aspiration had become the
humble Christian's faith. Unable amid perishing
nature to believe that one who died could live
again, Job wishes that he could be hid "in the
under-world," concealed for "an appointed time, then
remembered." All the days of his hard time there he
would await his "change." And finally he does believe
that his Vindicator will secure something like this;
not that he expects to live for ever, but, however
wasted his body, he will live long enough to see
Elohim no longer an adversary, but on his side.
With Paul this belief has arrived at the phase of
comparing the human body to a seed which rises to a
flower. After the alleged resurrection of Jesus it was
evidently important to show that it was the same
body, even to its wounds, but at the same time so
transformed that it was with difficulty recognised, and
was mistaken for a spirit. In the <i>Gospel according to
the Hebrews</i> (Nicholson, p. 68) it is written, after the
story of James living without food until he saw Jesus
risen from the dead, that "when he (Jesus) came
to those about Peter, he said to them, 'Take, feel
me, and see that I am not a bodiless dæmon.'"
Ignatius, who preserved this, says (<i>Ep. ad Smyrnæos</i>,
c. iii.), "I both know that he was in the flesh after
the resurrection and believe that he is [in it]....
And straightway they touched him and believed, being
constrained by his flesh and spirit Because of
this they thought lightly even of death, and were
found superior to death. And after the resurrection
he ate and drank with them as one in the flesh
though spiritually united to the Father."

The main difficulty about earthly immortality, presented
in the shrivelled form of Tithonus, solved in
Enoch's case by transfiguration, was settled in later
mythologies by the theory of a fountain of Perpetual
Youth. When Ponce de Leon heard of the New
World he hastened thither to find this Fountain: in
the depths of luxuriant Florida he searched, and
never reappeared.




VI.

MANTLES OF THE IMMORTALS.


We have already seen that in the Gospel of Nicodemus
(xxv.), Enoch and Elias are represented as welcoming
those who arrive in Paradise. In an Arabian legend
Grässe finds an important form of this tradition. It is
said that Enoch and Elias came to the Land of Darkness,
and there drank of the fountain of Perpetual
Youth; and thenceforth, one on land, the other on sea,
they went about to watch over pilgrims, much the same
as Castor and Pollux, who guarded wanderers. In the
intervals of such services they rest in gardens amid all
earthly joys. Towards the end of the world they will
appear to prepare the way for the Messiah. But in the
sixteenth year of the Hegira, Elias had not yet found
the Fountain. When the Arabians had conquered a
certain city they rested between two mountains of
Syria. At night when Fadilah, their commander,
began to pray, "Allah Akbar," a voice pronounced
the words and continued to the end of the prayer.
Fadilah at first thought it an echo, but presently knew
it could not be such, and appealed to him who had
spoken, if man and not a ghost, to appear. Then an
aged man with a staff appeared, and said, "I am here
by command of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has left
me in this world until his second coming. Therefore
I await this Lord who is the source of all happiness."
He gave his name as Zerib Ben Bar Elia. Fadilah
having asked if the end of the world were near or far,
Elia answered, "When there shall be no difference
in sex between men and women; when the blood of
innocents shall be shed; when abundance of food
shall not lessen its price; when the poor beg alms
without finding anything to live on; when love to
man shall be lost; when the Holy Scriptures shall be
put into songs; when temples dedicated to the true
God are filled with idols--then be sure that the Day
of Judgment is near!" Whereupon the old man disappeared.[18]

[Footnote 18: Herbelot: <i>Bibl. Orient.</i> iii. p. 607 (ref. by Grässe).]

Occasionally the cant of persons pretending to be
the Wandering Jew has faintly echoed this Eastern
specimen. As for the "two witnesses," it may be
remembered that we have already noticed (I.) efforts
made in the seventeenth century to prove that two
survivors from the time of the Crucifixion existed.
This could be done by regarding Cartaphilus ('the
famous Joseph') and Ahasuerus as different persons.
Or it may have been that Joseph and Malchus were
thought of, especially in Italy, where these seem to
have been the corresponding figures.

Jewish superstitions of this character were reinforced
from another direction. The Greeks had their
legend of the long sleep of Epimenides on the Isle of
Knossus. Epimenides being one of the Seven Sages,
there might easily grow from his legend that of the
Seven Sleepers.

The familiar form of this legend is that given by
Gibbon (xxxiii.), who follows Gregory of Tours, as an
incident of the Decian persecution. It is also in the
Koran (xviii.). Goethe follows the Koran mainly in
his poem on the subject, but assigns the legend to a
pre-Christian period, no doubt on good grounds.
According to this version the Sleepers were youths of
Cæsar's household who refused to worship that emperor
when he proclaimed himself a god; saying they would
worship him alone who had created the sun, moon,
and stars. Thereupon they departed, but Cæsar pursued
them; and when they had taken refuge in a
cavern near Ephesus, the emperor walled up the entrance,
so that they could not escape. After the
lapse of some centuries the wall gave way, and one of
them entered Ephesus to buy bread. He offered an
ancient coin; was suspected of having found treasure;
but by telling of various things hidden about the city,
unknown before, the story of the miraculous slumber
was confirmed. When the king and others went out
to visit the youths, the Angel Gabriel appeared,
closed the cavern, and led the Seven into Paradise.
According to the version which Goethe used, one of
the Seven was a faithful dog which had accompanied
the six young men, and passed into paradise
with them.[19]

[Footnote 19: A curious instance of the supremacy of the artist over the
man, when Goethe's horror of dogs is remembered. Goethe
threw up his connection with Weimar Theatre because Carl
August insisted on admitting, to 'perform' on the stage, the
animal which this poem introduces into Paradise.]

The tale of the Wanderings of Odysseus would
appear to have touched the Spanish variant of the
Seven Sleepers myth, which probably influenced the
mind of Columbus. According to this story, Seven
Bishops, flying from persecution, sailed westward and
reached a beautiful island where they built seven
splendid cities. This was dreamed of as the 'Island
of the Seven Cities' (Baring-Gould, <i>Curious Myths</i>,
ii. 277). A legend told by Washington Irving
relates that Don Fernando was wafted to this
island, where he dwelt in great happiness, until he one
day sank into unconsciousness. When he awakened
from this Circe spell, he found himself on his ship
near the Iberian coast. He repaired to the house of
a lady to whom he was affianced; she disclaimed all
knowledge of him; and when he addressed her by
name it appeared that he was thinking of her great-grandmother,
whom she closely resembled.[20]

[Footnote 20: This legend may, in turn, have helped to create the figure
of Don Juan, the unsaintly Wanderer whose story is possibly
related to the mythology we are considering. There are
interesting suggestions in Le Sage's <i>Diable Boiteux</i>, but the
figure of Don Juan awaits further study.]

These mingled Greek and Jewish traditions came
into Christendom mainly through the words Jesus is
reported to have said concerning John, "If I will that
he tarry till I come." It was on St. John that the
mantle of the undying saints first fell in the Christian
period. The place of his slumber was located beside
that of the Seven Sleepers, at Ephesus. The story
stands well-framed in the fossil English of the fourteenth
century traveller, Sir John Maundeville.

"From Pathmos men gon unto Ephesim, a fair
citie, and nyghe to the see. And there dyede Seynte
Johne and was buryed behynde the highe Awtiere, in
a Toumbe. And there is a fair Chirche. For Christene
Mere weren wont to holden that place aiweyes. And
in the Tombe of Seynt John is noughte but Manna,
that is clept Angeles Mete. For his Body was translated
in to Paradys. And Turkes holden now alle
that Place and the citee and the Chirche. And ail
Asie the lesse is y cleped Turkye. And zee shulle
undrestonde, that Seynt Johne leet make his Grave
there in his Lyfe, and leyd him self there inne alle
quyk. And therefore somme Men seyn, that he dyed
noughte, but that he restethe there till ten Day of
Doom. And forsothe there is a gret Marveyle: For
Men may see there the Erthe of the Tombe apertly
many tymes steren and meven, as there weren quykke
thinges undre."

The legends concerning Saint John given by St.
Hippolyte, followed by Eusebius, and Augustine, and
the ordeals he survived--such as drinking hemlock--were
suggestive of the potency of the words spoken
by Christ, however casually, "Tarry till I come." The
same formula spoken to the Wandering Jew made
him as indestructible as the disciple "whom Jesus
loved." Despite the ingenuity of the theory, one can
hardly doubt that M. Schoebel is right in supposing
that the Wanderer's early name, Cartaphilus, is formed
of the Greek κάρτα φίλος, signifying "the Beloved."




VII.

THE MARK OF CAIN.


In the Oberammergau Passion Play, where scenes
from the New Testament are preceded by tableaux
from the Old, Cain killing Abel is made to foreshadow
Judas betraying Jesus. In some Eastern lands Cain
has always been regarded as a Wanderer still living;
and to this day the Bedouin recognises his presence in
the hot Khamseen (Cain-wind), as in the destructive
hurricane the Picardy peasant exclaims, "<i>C'est le Juif
errant qui passe</i>." For a long time, indeed, Cain was
supposed to be the Wandering Jew, and possibly this
belief was thought of by Shakspeare (<i>King Richard II.</i>,
v. 6) in the words of Bolingbroke to Exton:

/p
"With Cain go wander through the shade of night,
 And never show thy head by day nor light."
p/

In <i>Tabari</i> (i. 30), Adam says:

/p
"We one have had in the midst of us whom death hath not yet found.
 No peace for him, no rest for him, treading the blood-drenched ground."
p/

The so-called 'mark' of Cain was conceived to be
a physical sign, and this appears in the legend of the
Wandering Jew: he was said to have the mark of a
blood-red cross on his forehead. Xeniola says the
Inquisition sought to secure him by this sign, but the
Wanderer concealed it under a black bandage.

In Rabbinical superstition Cain was not the son
of Adam but of Sammaël, the later demon derived
from wandering Esau. He (Cain) was banished to the
Wilderness of Dendain, where his companions are
Behemoth and Leviathan, who harm him not, though
they are ever fattened by devouring wicked mortals
in order that they may supply food for the righteous
amid the desolations preceding the last day.

As Cain wandered in a wilderness to the east of
Eden, in distinction from Seth, who dwelt in a fair
region of the west, so while St. John was bodily alive
in his paradise, Judas "went to his own place." As
Cain was son of Sammaël, Satan "entered into" Judas.

The obvious evil counterpart of John was Judas.
The two had sat nearest Jesus at the Last Supper, and
had come in contact with his immortalising flesh--one
by leaning on his breast, the other by a treacherous kiss.
A more potent security against death lay in the immediate
way in which Jesus gave to both the bread and
wine, of which he said, "he that eateth my flesh and
drinketh my blood shall never die." This was indeed
given to all of the disciples, and it was--still is--the
Christian theory that they who partake of the Eucharist
do not die, but "fall asleep." But there were always
degrees of quickening effect in this communion. Thus,
the Seven Sleepers of Tours, who came to that city to
receive the benediction of St. Martin, received from him
the Eucharist, and afterwards sank into an unconsciousness
from which they never awoke. Their bodies
remained, with all the external appearance of life in
their seven graves, still shown in front of their grotto.[21]

[Footnote 21: The present grotto was built in 1879. The old one, which
I saw the year before, had on its ceiling faint frescoes of the
sun, moon, and stars--recalling the legend of the Seven
Sleepers of Ephesus who turned their backs on Divus Cæsar,
saying they would worship him alone who made the sun, moon,
and stars. The angel Gabriel, who led them into Paradise,
guided them mythologically to Touraine, of old called "the Paradise
of France."]

It is doubtful whether any such person as Judas ever
lived. The name is the Greek form of Judah, and the
traitor may be a personification of the kingdom which
refused to part with the sceptre at the demand of the
Christian's "Shiloh," before whom alone, in the words
of Jacob, Judah was to surrender. It may also be that
this hostility was assigned the form of treachery, because
of a real Judas who, according to Josephus,
betrayed a fortress of Jerusalem to the army of Titus.
However this may be, even the circumstantial account
in the New Testament of his death could not save
Judas from becoming one of the evil wanderers.

But this fate of Judas was postponed because of circumstances
which brought a more important agent of
Antichrist to the front. While Rome was yet pagan,
and the Christians suffering there, the Man of Sin confronting
the Son of Man would naturally be visible
there. The mark of Cain is seen as the mark of the
Beast, and the forehead of the Beast was Nero. It so
happened that among the Romans themselves there
prevailed, for some time after his death, a belief that
Nero had not really died. The fears of some, the pride
of others, forbade them to believe that this powerful
representative of the throne of the Cæsars was no more,
and they looked for his return to give battle to the
rising kingdom of the Nazarene.[22]

[Footnote 22: This legend has been discussed by Mr. Call, in an essay
already referred to (p. 30). From references kindly supplied by
him, I incline to believe it of Eastern origin. It is mentioned
by Tacitus (Hist. ii. 81), and by the Sibylline Oracles (iv.), at
nearly the same period. Suetonius, Commodianus, Victorious,
and Sulpicias Severus, were familiar with the story that Nero
was still alive. Neander, Merivale, and Canon Farrar, connect
the legend with the formation of the theory of an Antichrist.]

But when Rome had been converted to Christianity,
it became necessary to transfer the <i>rôle</i> of
Antichrist to some race which still refused to surrender
to the new kingdom.

The one unconquerable race--outside Rome, where
the poor Jews had found their need of an immediate
revolution too strong for their sufferance and loyalty
to old traditions--was the Jewish. This people could
be tortured, driven from land to land under the curse
of Cain, but not converted to Christianity. Then
attention returned from Nero to Judas.

There was an ancient story about Cain, reproduced
in the Koran, but no doubt following the much earlier
rabbinical tradition before mentioned, that the Devil
came to Eve in a dream, when she was pregnant with
her first son, and persuaded her to call the child by a
name which meant "servant of Satan." In the course
of time a somewhat similar legend grew around the
phantasmal Judas. It was said that the mother of
Judas had a dream shortly before his birth, in which it
was disclosed to her that her son would murder his
father and sell his God. She and her husband thereupon
resolved that the child should not live, and at his
birth he was enclosed in a chest and cast into the sea.
But the sea cast him on shore, and he was found by a
king and queen, who adopted him. But they had
another son, whom Judas slew during a quarrel over a
game of chess. Thereupon he fled to Judea, and entered
the service of Pilate as his page. Having committed
other predestined crimes, including the murder of his
father, Judas learned from his mother the secret of his
birth, and of the dream that preceded it. In terror
and contrition, Judas hears of a prophet who has power
to forgive sins; he seeks out Jesus, throws himself at
his feet; and Jesus, recognising his predestined betrayer,
accepts him as a disciple, and entrusts him with
the purse, so that Judas's avarice might be cultivated
and this peculiarly divine scheme should not fail.
Judas was thus made a retrospective Wanderer.

In old Greek and Russian pictures, Judas is represented
on the knees of Satan as his beloved son,
beside the serpent which appears to be the dove in
this infernal trinity; but this Christian fable about
Judas would seem to show Satan indebted to Jesus
for his beloved son's training in wickedness.

That, according to the New Testament, Judas had
grief and remorse, and expiated his offence by death,
might naturally have awakened some compassionate
feeling for him, or sense of his humanity. But in the
mediæval faith this grief and remorse were not in him,
they were Furies sent to torment him. In the old
Passion Plays Remorse is a real personage, who
torments Judas until he invokes Despair, who lays
before him poison, a dagger, and a rope to choose
from. Nor was Christian logic equal to the consistency
of Disraeli's contention that, according to the
faith, the betrayal and crucifixion, being essential to
salvation, were compulsory on Judas and the Jews.

It will be remembered that the earliest recorded
Wandering Jew, Cartaphilus, informed the Armenian
Bishop that he had been Pilate's doorkeeper. By
this item he is linked with the legendary Judas, who
is said to have been a page in Pilate's palace. It may
now be remarked that Pilate also was the subject of a
somewhat similar legend. There are two classes of
legends concerning him. In the Abyssinian Church
Pilate became a martyr and a saint, his calendar day
being June 25. But in the south of Europe the story
ran that Pilate became a remorseful Wanderer. He
committed suicide by drowning himself in a tarn on
Mount Pilate, near Lucerne. It is a myth, as Professor
Sayce has shown, evolved from the old name of the
mountain--"Pileatus," meaning capped (either with
foliage or cloud[23]). That little lake has lost all its
natural picturesqueness. It is called the "infernal
lake." Now and then, in the dusk, a man is seen to
emerge and wash his hands in it as in a basin; when
he disappears a hurricane follows.

[Footnote 23: <i>Introduction to the Science of Language</i>, vol. ii. p. 246. "It
is remarkable," adds Professor Sayce, "that a French range of
hills in the neighbourhood of Vienne bears the same name as
the Swiss mountain, and from the same cause. Vienne, however
was actually the place to which Pilate was banished; and
the accidental coincidence is a striking example of the impossibility
of our discovering historic truth in a myth, although
we may know from other sources that it has accidentally
attached itself to a real event. Close to Vienne is a ruin called
the 'Tour de Mauconseil,' from which, it is said, Pilate threw
himself in despair. But the value of the legend may be easily
estimated when we learn that the tower is really a <i>tête-du-pont</i>
built by Philippe de Valois."]

The curse of Cain came upon yet another name,--Malchus.
This servant of Caiaphas, whose ear cut
off by Peter was healed by Jesus, had no reason to be
thankful, it would appear by the legend; this relates
that he struck Christ with an iron gauntlet, and was
doomed to walk around a column underground,
against which he vainly dashes his head, until Judgment
Day. We have already seen (I.) that the
Wandering Jew, under the name of Joseph, was reported
as undergoing a similar punishment in Jerusalem,
in 1641. The story of Malchus seems to blend
that of Ahasuerus with the Talmudic myth of Cain,
which is related in Mr. Baring-Gould's <i>Curious Myths</i>
(ii. p. 116). When Seth sought the Tree of Knowledge
in order to plant a scion of it in the grave of Adam,
(see VIII.), he saw its roots in Hell, and Cain trying
to climb thereby into Paradise. The roots laced
themselves around Cain and pierced him through and
through, holding him bound in living agony for ever.

According to Christian and Jewish revelations Cain
must have discovered that, in his fratricide, he
had been unsophisticated in the art of punishing an
offender against one's will. The divine method is more
ingenious. In the romance of Huon de Bordeaux
(13th Cent.) by Huon de Villeneuve, the writer reports
having seen a cask, with serpents and iron prongs
inside, rolling rapidly along. Cain is shut in it, and
therein must roll on till the end of the world. This
rolling cask would appear to be the prison and punishment
of Malchus, adapted to the idea of perpetual
wandering. Al Sâmeri was also called <i>Al kharaïti</i>,
"the turner." Professor D'Ancona (<i>Nuova Antologia</i>,
Oct., 1880, "La Leggenda dell' Ebreo Errante") shows
that the story of Malchus is Italian. M. Gaston Paris
ascribes it great antiquity, identifying the name and
idea with the legend of Marcus the Leper, which is old
enough to be represented in early Italian proverbs.
This Marcus, having been cured by Jesus, afterwards
struck him, and the curse laid upon him was held to
explain the incurability of leprosy. M. Paris finds
in this legend the idea of the blow given Jesus.
If with this are combined the legend of Joseph of
Arimathea (thrown into prison by the Jews, where his
life was miraculously preserved), and the words to St.
John, we have, he thinks, the story of Cartaphilus.




VIII.

THE JEW IN THEOLOGY.


The fable concerning Judas is one of many which
indicate the formation of a special Christian doctrine
concerning the Jewish race.

After the ruin of their Temple at Jerusalem and
desolation of their city, the Jews made repeated efforts--like
that led by Bar-Cocheba--to recover their
independence. As the possibility of recovering their
city and rebuilding their Temple faded away they
managed, even in their dispersed condition, to constitute
an <i>imperium in imperio</i> under an officer called
Resh Gelutha, or "Prince of the Captivity." As was
natural, they never lost an opportunity of opposing
the new empire, of which Jesus had been made
General. In the fourth century they joined the
Arians. When Julian was called the Apostate he
gave them leave to rebuild their Temple at Jerusalem,
their hope of doing which was suddenly quenched by
that Emperor's death. These great events, of which
the most typical can alone be mentioned here, were
steadily constituting a definite creed concerning
the Jewish race, a creed afterwards to be written upon
all Europe in their blood, and illustrated in the flames
that consumed them.

The Christians believed that the Jews, as a race,
gave themselves up to be the devil's agent for the
crucifixion of Christ. Even the idea of converting
them seems hardly to have occurred to any Christian
before the Reformation--unless the Holy Cross Day
torture at Rome be called such--and, justly as the
Jews now resent the efforts of conversionists, the
existence of a Society of that kind is a result of the
tardy recognition of their humanity. The scenes of
the Passion--so long preached, pictured, acted on
the stage--cast upon the Jews a shadow never relieved,
and were a perpetual instruction in horror of that
people. The supernatural character ascribed to them
by Christians as well as themselves, implied, since
they had rejected Christ, infranatural wickedness.
They were to Christendom the chosen people still,
but now chosen of Satan.

While the sacred names and superstitions of the
Jewish people were preserved, a deadly hatred of those
who had really founded Christianity, and furnished
its Messiah, was carefully fostered. The connection
of Christianity with Judaism was reduced to a series
of fairy-tales. Characteristic of these was that about the
True Cross. Seth receives from the Archangel Michael
a branch of the Tree of Knowledge to plant in Adam's
grave, and is told that when it should bear fruit Adam
would recover. Out of Adam's grave grows the Tree,
which Solomon hews down for the Temple. The
workmen cannot so adapt it, and it is used as a bridge
over a lake. The Queen of Sheba, crossing it, beholds
a vision of Christ on the Cross, and informs Solomon
that when a certain person shall be suspended on that
wood the fall of the Jewish nation would be at hand.
Solomon in alarm buries the wood, and then springs
over it the pool of Bethesda. Shortly before the
crucifixion the tree floated on the water, and ultimately,
as a cross, bore its fruit. The Jews concealed
the Cross, while pagans built a Temple of Venus on
the spot where it stood. Helena, mother of Constantine,
having sentenced a Jew to torture and death,
remits the punishment on condition that he will inform
her where the Cross is. Out of the three found the
true one manifests itself by performing cures. Thus
the Cross itself was a holy immortal Wanderer, with
the branded Jew ever beside it, seeking to destroy or
bury it.

Race-hatred had much to do with the shaping of
this theology, which anathematised the race from
whose primitive superstitions it was chiefly borrowed,
without discrimination or comprehension.

The "anti-Semitic" venom crept for ages through the
veins of Christendom. Fed by millions of pulpits the
deadly stream percolated through the world, and a
consistent theory concerning the Jews was formed,
not very different from that which at length appeared in
Swedenborg's pious phantasmagoria. In the history
of Israel, says Mr. White, Swedenborg "sees nothing
but selfish Jacob over and over again; and throughout
the <i>Arcana Celestia</i> he pursues the Jews with one
whip of epithets as the basest of mankind."[24] The
Jewish race was "chosen" by God not because of
their excellence, but for their baseness: their lack of
interior religion made them fit actors in a drama
where literalness was needed; their sensuality adapted
them to be the instrument of incarnation; and Jesus
was born of a Jewish mother because he could go
no lower! "In that body, whose every faculty was an
avenue to the Hells, he met as on a battle-field the
Powers of Evil and Darkness and subdued them."
A fine offset this to the late Lord Beaconsfield's proud
reflection that the majority of Christendom hold a
Jewess to be Queen of Heaven! It is true that Mary
was excepted by Christendom from the general curse
which it saw resting upon the Jewish race; but her
exaltation, in the fifth century, was largely due to
legends of the Jews, which represented her as an
unchaste woman. Her apotheosis among Christians
was the other side of her condemnation by the Jews;
their vision of her in Hell was replied to in the
story of her Assumption. The Jews were never benefited
by any of the holy personages transmitted from
their race for the homage of Christendom. They were
held to be the official persecutors and crucifiers of
such as were divinely sent unto them: whatever the
light seen in their history, the only credit of the Jews
was to lie under the shadow it cast.

[Footnote 24: <i>Emanuel Swedenborg; his Life and Writings.</i> By
William White. (Simpkin, Marshall and Co., 1868.) P. 197, <i>sq.</i>]

It was largely through the Miracle Plays that hatred
of the Jews, diffused by mediæval homilies, gained the
shape which proved so fatal to the Jews. On the
stage the holy drama represented a great struggle
between the hosts of Heaven and Hell, of which the
scene was on earth. In that drama the Jewish
race was not merely the "heavy villain," it was the
incarnation of all devils. It would appear that for a
thousand years no Christian regarded any Jew as a
man at all. In those excesses of cruelty too wild to
be now comprehensible--when every European river
ran red with Jewish blood, when Jews' eyes and teeth
were plucked out and their bodies burnt as torches
in saturnalia beside which those of Nero with his
Christian martyrs were trivial--it is plain that there
was an epidemic possession wrought by the long
education of the people in the belief that the Jews, from
a supernatural, had become an infranatural people.

They from whose ears the reported denunciations
of the Jews by Jesus--as "of their Father the Devil,"
as "vipers," "children of Hell"--were never suffered
to die out, and who avenged the crucifixion
of one man by the crucifixion of a race for centuries,
are condemned for inhumanity. But the
charge is inexact. They were as charitable as are
their posterity to those whom they regarded as human
beings. Their theology had dehumanised the Jews,
and its progress was traced in Christian inhumanities
wrought in pious zeal for the Trinity. It was not a
suspicion admitted into any mind, thus sophisticated,
that it was a man against whom Judas and the Jews
had raised their hand. It was against the Eternal
Majesty. That they saw as the obvious functional
work of Satan. It was the culminating attack in an
eternal war against God. Hence those perpetual
dooms beheld overhanging all concerned in the crucifixion,
which denoted the unpardonable and everlasting
nature of the offence against the eternal Avenger
of his honour. It is only the God of Theology whose
vengeance never sleeps nor ends with any generation,
whose wrath is fresh every day, and his hell eternal.
Only when man has had his human heart dexterously
removed, and has become the changeling of some
vampyre Phantasm he coweringly adores, could he be
the instrument of the crimes that Christianity has
committed against humanity.

Seven times shall Cain be avenged, seventy and
seven times Lamech, ran the old song; but Jesus
said, seventy times seven shalt thou forgive. The
human Jesus was speedily overlaid and lost beneath
the myths that gathered around the passive Jesus--the
babe, the dead body. No holiday was appointed
for the Sermon on the Mount, nor was there any
Festival of the Golden Rule.




IX.

THE JEW IN FOLK-LORE.


It is related in the <i>Legenda Aurca</i> of John Capgrave
that St. Brendain, on his famous voyage, came to an
island filled with beautiful birds whose music entranced
the souls of listeners. The birds told the
saint that they had been angels; when the rebel
angels plotted their designs in heaven they had been
tempted by the Archfiend to join his party; they did
not yield, but dallied with the temptation, and when
the wicked beings were cast into the sea of fire, they
were transformed into birds. They sang hymns of
joy, awaiting their release.

On the other hand, the ill-omened "Seven Whistlers"
or "Seven Plovers," of English superstition are
said to have been Jews who assisted in the crucifixion
of Jesus.

These birds are types of the fables that flitted about
the world in the Middle Ages, each the transformation
and diminution of their like which had been set free
by the decay of both European and Jewish mythology.
Christianity had preserved both with care.
The Jewish mythology it had disintegrated and recombined
for its own supernatural authentication; to
the European deities it had given a new lease of life
by degrading them to devils, affirming their power to
haunt and harm their former worshippers. If there
had been any kindly attributes or pleasant tales associated
with these deities they were transferred to the
Christian saints; if any evils had been told of such,
they were intensified under the sweeping anathema of
the new religion.

Into this miasmatic atmosphere anti-Semitic prejudice
and theology were diffused. The same process
as that just mentioned concerning "paganism"
presently overtook the Jews. When all hope of
changing or exterminating it had passed away the
theological theory was naturally formed by which all
the good in the Jewish system was transferred to
Christianity, and everything repulsive was diabolised.
Unfortunately for the Jews their anathema came later
than that which had degraded the deities and beliefs
of pagan Europe; their sacred forms, rites, superstitions
were the more vivid; so that the fading phantoms
of European mythology were able to acquire
new life by union with the fresher ones imported from
the East. In this way the demons, gnomes, witches,
which, from representing the majesty as well as the
menace of nature, had been doomed to bear responsibility
for all its cruelties, now came to nestle with the
Jews. These were already the normal scapegoat for
the fall of man and martyrdoms of Christians; now
there entered into them a troop of imaginary horrors
worse than any known to their most barbarous days.
Of these a few characteristic examples may be
selected from the very large number known to every
student of folk-lore.

The periodical assemblies of witches believed to
occur in various wild places were called "Witches'
Sabbaths," because Jews were supposed to be the chief
attendants at them. They there received their wages
for supporting the kingdom of Antichrist. They
celebrated a grand mass before the Devil. The blood
of Christian children was said to be essential to their
sacrifices. In some regions where, under the ancient
religion, the effigy of winter had been burnt on one or
another day of spring, it became the custom to burn it on
Good Friday and under the name of Judas. The ceremony
of scourging and burning Judas still takes place
annually in the London Docks. In Spain it is considered
necessary to spit after pronouncing the word
"Jew;" and from that country the paganised effigies
of that people have spread through distant regions
of the world. In some regions (as Oldenberg) the
birthday of poor everlasting Judas is said to be
February 14, in others (as Franconia) it is fixed as
April 1, and these days are unlucky. The stigma
of Iscariot passed upon certain trees, as the aspen,
which was said to tremble perpetually because he
hung upon it; and the Judas-tree, with its blood-drop
blossoms. In the Bergstrasse, or high road
between Darmstadt and Heidelberg, the peasantry
still believe that every Jew possesses the "evil eye,"
and that if a sick person wishes to die swiftly he must
get a Rabbi to pray for his convalescence. In sundry
places Jews are believed able to foretell the weather
by means of dividing a loaf of bread, putting the
parts together again, and shoving it with a mysterious
word into an oven. They are also believed to spread
diseases by spells written in Hebrew on bits of paper,
and to deal in such charms. In some regions noises
heard in mines were indifferently attributed to
kobolds, or to the ghosts of Jews believed to have
been made to work in them as slaves by the Romans.
In East Friesland it is considered very unlucky to meet
a Jew first in the morning; if a Jew is the first to enter
one's house on Monday, or even to look into the window,
it renders the whole week unlucky to the house,
and was once an offence that might be prosecuted.[25]
Other Jews impaled in the ever-repeated Christian
legend took on, in the popular imagination, the diabolical
forms into which the pagan deities had been degraded
by missionaries. In storms Herod was said still
to hunt the Innocents. The Perigord peasant names
the fierce thunderstorm "la chasse Herode." This
was probably an ingenious development of the Herr-Rote,
or Haar-Rote, the red-haired demon-huntsman.
Associated with him was Herodias. Grimm says that
the Italians sometimes identify their misshapen fairy
Befana--a terror to children, who has sprung out of
Epiphania--as Herod's daughter (Salome); so that both
mother and daughter were made into evil wanderers.[26]
Herodias, who prompted her daughter to demand the
head of John the Baptist, was associated with Diana
and Holda in the nocturnal expeditions of demons
and witches. She was at the head of an aerial host
of such. Only from midnight to cockcrow can she
rest, and then sits upon oaks and hazel-trees. She
was said to have an unrequited passion for John,
and when his head was brought in on a charger would
have kissed it, but it recoiled and blew upon her, and
she was whirled into the air, where she wanders. In
Lower Saxony whirlwinds are accounted for by the
dancing of Herodias, as elsewhere to that of the devil.
Herod and Herodias are said by Josephus to have
been banished to Lyons, and eventually to have died
in Spain; perhaps this may account for the special
prominence she holds in the folk-lore of Spanish
America. In Mexico the puppet Herodias dances in
a kind of Punch and Judy show in Holy Week, to the
music of rattles made of "Judas bones." In Eugene
Sue's <i>Wandering Jew</i> Herodias appears in Arctic
America. M. Gaston Paris cites several Italian proverbs
in which Judas and Malchus are united (as in
Sicily, <i>lu Juda--Marcu</i>) to characterise an ugly or unpleasant
countenance. It has been thought (though
I have not investigated the matter) that our puppet-show,
<i>Punch and Judy</i>, is a distant outcome of an old
play, <i>Pontius cum Judæis</i>, in which the Jews were
severely handled by the pro-consul.

X.

THE WEIRD OF THE WANDERER.


There is one class of survivals from the fatalistic
ideas of all so-called paganisms which have always
been very strong in the popular mind of Europe. It
was a creed in which all ancient faiths converged,
that an irresistible power was lodged in any officially-uttered
curse. The word once solemnly spoken, became
the weird, the fatum, and not even the tongue
that spake could revoke it. Oftenest the dooms that
represented this belief in the Middle Ages were
supposed to come from Heaven in response to some
defiant invocation, or blasphemous challenge like that
of the Flying Dutchman. It is a notable fact for the
antiquarian that in the year 1881 the courts of England
should be trying a case involving the question of
whether a lecturer took out his watch and gave the
deity, whose existence he denied, five minutes to strike
him dead. That is an old myth normally fixed on
misbelievers; and it is probable that the motives for
selecting that particular slander for judicial denial, if
traced out, would be found connected with the ancient
superstition that such words must have the eternal
effect of real natural forces. From the ancient
patriarchalism, which has so many political and social
survivals in Europe, came the idea that a father's
curse (or blessing) carried with it the fatal forces of
the universe. More universal still was the potency
supposed to attend the word of a priest, however
casual. This notion is still met with in the many
stories of persons said to have died soon after ridiculing
the proceedings of "revivalists."

Grässe has collected some examples of such superstitions
in Europe, beginning so far back as the legend
of Domitilla, the grand-daughter of Domitian. In
her room, after she had become a Christian, her husband
introduced dancers to win her back to the world
and to himself: he began showing them how to dance,
but could not stop; and after dancing two days and
nights, died. Such "dances" are now familiar in
folk-lore, and are associated with some of the stone
circles of England. In Kolbeck, near Halbustadt,
there is a legend that, in the year 1012, a peasant
named Albrecht and fifteen others who danced before
the Church on Christmas while Mass was going on,
were ordered by the priest to dance for a year. The
Bishop of Cologne had to come and release these
dancers, who had worn a deep hole in the ground. In
the same vein is the story of "the merry smith of
Jüterbogk," a small survival of Sisyphus. A remarkable
story of this kind is that of Freiburg (A. Müller,
<i>Theatr. Freiburg Chron.</i>, 1633). An irritable father,
Lorent Richter, ordered his son of fourteen years to
do something: the boy hesitated, standing in the
middle of the room. "Cursed boy," cried the father,
"may you stand there for ever!" The boy remained
standing there, propped by supports, and after many
years the priests, by many prayers, could only secure
the small commutation of a removal to a corner where
he would not be so much in the way of the household.
"At last the kind God a little altered the punishment
by allowing him to sit during the last six months of
the year, and also to lie in a bed placed near him.
When asked what he did, he answered that he was
punished by God the Lord for his sins; that he left
all to His will; and trusted in the merits of Christ to
obtain final happiness." After seven years--a number
associated with many famous sleepers--the boy "was
relieved, 11th Sept., 1552." His footprints were
pointed out on the floor for a hundred years. The
father had wished to obliterate this memento of his
anger, but the authorities decided that the footprints
should remain as a warning to wrathful parents and
disobedient children.

The great majority of "dooms" known to Northern
paganism have exchanged connotations with the legend
of the Wandering Jew. The sentence pronounced
upon such royal huntsmen or robber-knights as
Dyterbjernat of Danzig, Diedrick of Bern, Duke Abel
the fratricide (Schleswig), and others, is usually of this
character. In the Netherlands it is the story of a son
who refused to listen to his father's Christian advice,
but called his dogs into the wood: the father cried,
"Hunt, then, for ever!" and so he hunts on, and his
voice, mingled with the baying of dogs, is heard in
the woods about the Castle of Wynedal. In Thuringia,
it is Hakelnberg who would not listen to the priest,
who bade him "hunt until the last day." These formulas
of the curse are related to that of the Jew
legend: the primitive pagan legend is different, <i>e.g.</i>
the hunt long known as the Horlething, on the banks
of the Wye. It was said King Herla went to the
marriage feast of a dwarf: when he returned to his
palace he found that he had been in the mountain
with the dwarf two hundred years, and was under a
doom to ride on until the day of judgment. The
visit to the dwarfs festival simply meant a relapse
into paganism.

That the myth of the Wandering Jew was interwoven
with that of the Demon Huntsman of Germany (which
is called Aaskarreya in Norway), there can be no
doubt. "Perhaps," says Karl Blind, "one of the
clearest proofs of the phantom figure of the Wandering
Jew having been grafted upon that of the great
Wanderer and World-hunter, Wodan, is to be found
in a tale of the Hartz Mountains. There it is said
that the Wild Huntsman careers 'over the seven
mountain-towns every seven years.' The reason
given for his ceaseless wanderings is, that 'he would
not allow our Lord Jesus Christ to quench his thirst
at a river, nor at a water-trough for cattle, from both
of which he drove him away, telling him that he ought
to drink from a horse-pond.' For this reason the
Wild Huntsman must wander about for ever, and feed
upon horseflesh. And whoever calls out after him,
when his ghostly chase comes by, will see the Wild
Huntsman turn round, and be compelled by him to
eat horseflesh too. No allusion whatever is made in
this tale to a Jew, though the name of Christ is pressed
into it in a way very like the Ahasuerus legend. We
seem to get here a mythic rendering of the struggle
between the old Germanic faith and the Christian
religion. The 'horse-pond' and the 'horseflesh'
are, to all appearances, references to our horse-worshipping,
horse-sacrificing, horseflesh-eating forefathers,
who came to Britain under the leadership of Hengist
and Horsa. To call out after the eternal Huntsman
entails the danger of being forced by him to eat
horseflesh--that is, to return to the old creed. The
Holy Supper of the Teutonic tribes consisted of horseflesh
and mead. When Christianity came in, the
eating of horseflesh was abolished as a heathen custom.
But at German witches' banquets--in other
words, at secret festive ceremonies in which the pagan
traditions were still kept up--there continued for a
long time a custom of drinking from horse-shoes."[27]

[Footnote 27: <i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, July, 1880. <i>Wodan, the Wild
Huntsman, and the Wandering Jew.</i>]

We have in this sentence last quoted from Mr. Blind's
able article a suggestion of the probable origin of the
horse-shoe as a charm against witches. To the pagan
Teuton it was as sacred an emblem as to the Christian
his cross. While the Christians still believed in the
power of the Wild Huntsman and his train to work
them mischief, they might naturally show this symbol
of pagan orthodoxy over their doors to induce the
witches to pass on and visit their wrath on the openly
disloyal.

This article in <i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i> contains
an original speculation and theory concerning two
remarkable problems connected with our legend.
How is it that the name Cartaphilus was replaced by
Ahasuerus? How did the "doorkeeper" of the thirteenth
century become the "shoemaker" of the sixteenth
century legend? Mr. Blind, with a creditable
caution, suggests that the name may have been a
modification of As-Vidar. This god (<i>As</i>) Vidar was
in the Scandinavian mythology the symbol of everlasting
force: he was the deity who was alone to survive
the universal destruction of Ragnarök, "Twilight
of the Gods." In the Prose Edda it is written: "The
Wolf (Fenris) swallows Odin, but at that instant
Vidar advances, and setting his foot on the monster's
lower jaw, seizes the other with his hand, and thus
tears and rends him till he dies. Vidar is able to do
this because he wears shoes for which stuff has been
gathering in all ages, namely, the shreds of leather
which are cut off to form the toes and heels of shoes;
and it is on this account that those who would render
a service to the Æsir (gods) should take care to
throw such shreds away." It is said there are (or
were) preserved in the Government Library at Berne
traditional relics left by the Wandering Jew, his staff
and pair of shoes. These shoes are said, by an early
local authority, to be "uncommonly large and made
of a hundred snips--a shoemaker's master-piece, because
patched together with the utmost labour, diligence,
and cleverness out of so many shreds of leather."
A similar pair of shoes are said to have also been left
by Ahasuerus at Ulm.

It may be remarked that the name given to the
Wandering Jew in the <i>Praxis Alchymine</i> of Libavius,
viz., Buttadæus, may possibly refer to the boot (A. S.
<i>butte</i>) of the Wanderer, and it may have been that
<i>deus</i> was added. Whether it meant the "booted god,"
or the man who struck God with a boot, or <i>bouter dieu</i>
(to push God), must remain doubtful. It is a striking
coincidence, if no more, that, in Talmudic legend,
Enoch also was a shoemaker, who with every stitch
exclaimed, "The Lord and His Majesty be praised!"

The names of the Wandering Jew are characteristically
various, not to say vagarious; they are also
sometimes puzzling. Cartaphilus is pretty certainly
κάρτα φίλος, in allusion to the "beloved" disciple;
Ahasuerus is perhaps the Hebrew form of Xerxes,
though there is nothing in the history of that king to
connect him with the Wandering Jew. Several give
his name as Gregorius, through a mistake, as M. Paris
has pointed out, as to the meaning of Botoreius, who
wrote that Jesus stopped "ante tabernam gregorii
illius;" the Turkish Spy names him Michob Ader.
One name popularly ascribed to him in Brussels
is "Isaac Laquedem." Concerning this Grässe has
a note in which he says, "I asked for an explanation
of the word, and my friend Dr. Böttcher, the
celebrated expert in Hebrew, gave me the following
answer, 'If the name Laquedem is written and
pronounced in French (Walloon) "Lakedem," and is
derived from the Hebrew, it can scarcely be anything
else but la-kĕdem, <i>i.e.</i>, "the former world"
[belonging to an anterior world], in which case we
must say the use of the prefix "la" is without a parallel
in names of later Jews, and therefore the "la," the
French article, may be considered due to a half-learned
inventor of names (<i>vide</i> Lacroix, Lamarque,
La Loresh. Wolf, <i>Bibl. Hebr.</i> iv. 812).'"

As for the name "Joseph," given by the Armenian
Bishop as the baptismal name of Cartaphilus, there is
evidence in the old Chronicle itself that it was derived
by association with Joseph of Arimathea, who is said
to have wandered through a large part of the world
and to have come to Britain in the year 66, where his
blossoming staff fixed the site of Glastonbury Abbey.

It is an indication of the steadiness with which
every being, however exalted originally, was degraded
by coming under the supposed preternatural fate of
the Jewish race, that this Joseph of Arimathea, by
giving a baptismal name to Cartaphilus, gave the
English populace their epithet for the beggars or
impostors who were supposed to be the Wandering
Jew. He was called "Poor Joe!" Of him, as representing
the dregs of the myth, more must be said
hereafter. Another example of this degradation is
shown in the fact that in various parts of Europe the
storm-demon is called <i>Maccabee</i>. The process by which
this was brought about has not, to my knowledge,
been traced, but the following facts seem to bear on it.

In 2 Maccabæus, v. 2-4, it is written--"Then it happened
that through all the city, for the space almost
of forty days, there were seen horsemen running in the
air, in cloth of gold, and armed with lances like a band
of soldiers.... Wherefore every man prayed that that
apparition might turn to good." These apparitions,
resembling those said by Josephus to have reappeared
at the siege of Jerusalem, were adopted as good
Christian omens. Judas Maccabæus also records his
vision of the prophet Jeremiah giving him a golden
sword to defend the holy people. It is probable that
this was the germ of the superstition which proved so
fatal to the Christians at the siege of Constantinople.
(1453). After the capture of the city, men, women
and children rushed into the Church of St. Sophia for
protection, because of a prophecy that "one day the
Turks would enter Constantinople and pursue the
Romans as far as the column of Constantine in the
square before St. Sophia; but that this would be the
term of their calamities; that an angel would descend
from heaven with a sword in his hand, and would
deliver the empire, with that celestial weapon, to a
poor man seated at the foot of the column. 'Take
this sword,' would he say, 'and avenge the people of
the Lord.' At these animating words the Turks
would instantly fly.... While they expected the
descent of the tardy angel, the doors were broken
with axes; and, as the Turks encountered no resistance,
their bloodless hands were employed in selecting
and securing the multitude of their prisoners" (Gibbon,
ch. lxviii.).

It looks as if the association of the wild aerial chase
with <i>Maccabee</i>, in France and other southern regions,
might have resulted from the diffusion of the superstition
which drew such a thunderbolt upon the Christians
of Constantinople, and its gradual subjection to
the demonising doom which rested upon even the
brightest figures of Jewish history not wearing the
Christian uniform.




XI.

"THE VERY DEVIL INCARNATION."


"Enter Launcelot Gobbo!" So begins Scene ii. of
Act II. in the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>. Or as the original
stage-direction ran, "Enter the Clown!" His very
name suggests the glutton and knave, yet it seems to
be from him some Shakspearian guides derive their
chief light on the great poet's picture of Shylock!

Gobbo does indeed cast light upon the Jew, but it
comes from the mob which he represented. To say
"my master is a very Jew," and "the Jew ... is the
devil himself," are equivalent phrases in the capacious
mouth of Gobbo. He speaks for his gaping herd, and
their breed is not unknown. Judenhetze is able to
turn out such men in the latter days of the nineteenth
century.

Bochart, in his <i>Hierozoicon</i> (seventeenth century), says
there was a Sea-monster called "The Old Jew;" with
the white-bearded face of a man he had the hairy body
of an ox, otherwise calf-shaped. This monster always
appeared the night before Saturday on the surface of
the sea, and one could see him until sunset next day
leaping and diving like a frog, and following ships.
This monster, no doubt a variety of Al-Sâmeri,
elsewhere considered, is a fair type of what every Jew
was, for many centuries, in the eyes of the multitudinous
Gobbites. What stood for religion in them was
the vulgar ribaldry of the Miracle Plays, under which
those holy farces presently perished. In them Judas,
still the buffeted Wanderer, was the one figure-head
of the Jewish race, with the devil for his familiar.

In ancient Persian pictures Ahriman and his host
have flame for hair. After the introduction of Christianity
the deities of Europe, which it degraded to
devils, were described and painted with fiery hair and
beard; as it stands in the German saying, "Roter
Bart, Teufelsart." In the early Miracle Plays Judas
was made up with red hair and beard to show the
fiery abode to which he belonged. This feature survived
also in the "yellow bonnet" which the Jews
were compelled to wear, which replaced the scarlet or
red bonnets which the "Scarlet Woman" found too
like her own.[28] The significant costume, and the ideas
it expressed, passed to the conventional stage-Jew.
Barabas, in Marlowe's <i>Jew of Malta</i>, and after him,
Shylock, were represented with the "orange-tawny
bonnet," and fiery red hair and beard.

[Footnote 28: See Knight's <i>Shakspeare</i>, notes to the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>.--Blanco
White, in his <i>Letters from Spain</i> (1806), speaking of
the Passion Week shows, says: "The dress of the Apostle John
is green, that of Judas yellow; and so intimately associated
is this circumstance with the idea of the traitor, that it has
brought that colour into universal discredit.... The Inquisition
has adopted it for the <i>Sambeníto</i>, a coat of infamy, which
persons convicted of heresy are compelled to wear. The red
hair of Judas, like Peter's baldness, seems to be agreed upon by
all the painters and sculptors of Europe. <i>Judas' hair</i> is a usual
name in Spain; and a similar appellation, it should seem, was
used in England in Shakspeare's time. "His hair" says Rosalind,
"is of the dissembling colour." To which Celia answers
"Something browner than Judas's."]

In keeping with this the crimes popularly ascribed
to the Jews, for which they suffered so terribly, were
not human crimes. They were utterly without motive--such
as no man, however vile, could have committed.
For one example out of many, the Jews of
Lincoln were charged with having fattened a Christian
child of eight years on white bread and milk, then
scourged him, crowned him with thorns, crucified him,
giving him gall. For that impossible crime 112
eminent Jews were tortured and slain. It was
rumoured that the earth would not receive the body
of that child, yet for years Christian pilgrims visited
its grave.

Such wild, popular notions were faithfully reflected
in Marlowe's <i>Jew of Malta</i>. "Barabas," says Charles
Lamb, "is a mere monster, brought in with a large
painted nose, to please the rabble. He kills in sport--poisons
whole nunneries--invents infernal machines.
He is just such an exhibition as, a century or two
earlier, might have been played before the Londoners,
<i>by the Royal command</i>, when a general pillage and
massacre of the Hebrews had been previously resolved
on in the cabinet."

It will be now apparent to those who have followed
the travels of this Jew-myth that it had carried about
in its endless wanderings the belief in which it
originated, and of whose development it was a type--the
infranatural, finally the infernal, nature of the
Jewish race. It inevitably blended with all the superstitions
about uncanny phantoms, bringing the most
evil and ominous shapes haunting the popular
imagination in every locality into connection with the
detested race. Demons from the air, goblins from
their caves, birds of ill-omen, fearful gales, betokening
the proximity of the Wandering Phantom, brought
an ever-accumulating mass of fear, suspicion and
hatred upon the race of which its supposed doom was
a too faithful emblem. This vast cesspool of vulgar
superstition mirrored the dogmas of a theology ever
developing downward. It was not permitted the
masses to look upon the alleged offences of Judas or
Ahasuerus in comparison with offences familiar to
them. As we have seen, the offence thought of was
the wrong and insult done to a God; it was an intensification
of the same feeling that regarded theft from
a church as worse than theft from the poorest widow,
or a slight untruth under oath as more wicked than
the most malicious lie not sworn to. Out of such a
principle of unreason naturally came the doom of a
race through many centuries to realise every ingenuity
of torture fabled in the Greek Hades, with Gehenna
added. Every revolving century was their Ixion-wheel,
and every stream their Phlegethon.




XII.

THE WANDERING RACE.


Professor Child, of Harvard University, has remarked
that, "in the second form of the legend, the
punishment of perpetual existence, which gives rise to
the old names, <i>Judæus non mortalis</i>, <i>Ewiger Jude</i>, is
aggravated by a condemnation to perpetual change of
place, which is indicated by a corresponding name,
<i>Wandering Jew</i>, <i>Juif Errant</i>, etc."[29] In this change a
great deal of history is represented. The Jewish race
under persecution steadily became a wandering race.
They were compelled to "move on" by the remorseless
police of Christendom. One after another the
laws of nations detached them from the soil, from the
trade-guilds, from civic position, and they became a
nation without a country.

[Footnote 29: <i>English and Scottish Ballads</i>, viii. 78.]

This process went on for a long time before it was
represented in any myth or legend. Mohammed
said, "The Jews are the People of the Book." Joshua
ben Siras ben Eliezer, a priest in Jerusalem two hundred
years before the burning of the Second Temple
(quoted by Heine), wrote, "All this is the Book of
the Covenant made with the Most High God, namely,
the Law which Moses commanded as a precious treasure
to the House of Jacob. Wisdom floweth therefrom
as the water of Pison when it is great, and as the
water of Tigris when it overfloweth its banks in
spring. Instruction floweth from it as the Euphrates
when it is great, and as Jordan in the harvest. Correction
cometh forth from it as the light, and as the
water of the Nile in autumn. There is none that
hath made an end of learning it, there is none that
will ever find out all its mystery, for its wisdom is
richer than any sea and its word deeper than any
abyss."

So spake the genius of Israel, and, so speaking,
itself uttered its first doom. A people to whom a
book had become their Fatherland, which had come
to see in it their Jordan, their Tigris, their Nile, had
already given up their hold upon the territories of
this world and become a wandering colony of Jahve,
governed by a code unrelated to the vices or the aims
of other races. This abstract country, whose geography
was books and texts, was fenced around and
fortified as strongly as the territory of any nation.
Its fortresses were ceremonies, customs, national
traditions, and a perfect patience derived from faith
in the God of their fathers. The Cain whom they
abhorred was not more effectually "cursed from the
earth," prohibited from tillage of the ground than this
race which had taken Jahve for their portion and his
law for their habitation.

In such a system there could be no compromise.
And as a matter of fact there never was any compromise
with the enemies of their faith. These people,
who have shown ingenuity and cleverness of every
kind, have never developed any sort of Jesuitism. I
was astonished lately at learning of an instance in
which a Jew outwitted his persecutors in true Christian
style, for I never heard of another. This Jew
was a pedlar, and he was wandering in France in the
neighbourhood of one of those districts where the
Virgin Mary is still continually opening new water-cure
establishments. This Jew, having heard the latest
miracle which had evoked a new fountain, smiled, and
even made light of it. Thereon the innkeepers excited
a mob, and they resolved to hang the <i>miscreant</i>--that
is, the unbeliever--faggots being old-fashioned. They
seized the poor pedlar and bore him off pallid with
terror. As they passed near the new fountain, the
Jew begged permission to moisten his lips thereat;
this was conceded, but no sooner had the water
touched his lips than he leaped about with joy, and
declared that the fountain had healed a severe rheumatism
which he had suffered from for many years.
"A miracle! a miracle!" shouted the crowd; the Jew
suddenly became a hero, and was carried before the
priest, who appointed the next day to baptize him
before all the people and make a grand demonstration.
The Jew, however, disappeared during the
night.

This story, which I found in a recent number of
the <i>Jewish World</i>, is a modern appendage to the old
legend mentioned by Mr. Baring-Gould, that the
gipsies were said to wander under a doom pronounced
on them because they refused to shelter the Virgin
and child in the flight into Egypt. But this witty
pedlar is not a fair representative of the race.
"Sufferance is the badge of all our tribe," said
Shylock. Though Shylock has been regarded by
many as a type of avarice and extortion, yet even he
cannot be tempted by money when his struggle with
the Merchant becomes a religious issue. Shakspeare
rightly shows Shylock unyielding; many times the
money due to him cannot bribe him from the blow he
feels empowered to strike for his despised Israel. And
when, in the beginning of this century, Nathan Rothschild
started as the great banker of London, no
temptations could induce him, shrewd as he was, to
lend money or enter into any contracts for the benefit
of Spain or its colonies. The Israelite was never lost
in the banker, and showed his supremacy when it
came to a race which had banished his own from the
Iberian Peninsula; though at the same time his
charities and those of his house have included Christians
hardly less than Jews. The same unyielding
religious spirit was shown when thirty-three years ago
Baron Lionel de Rothschild was elected Member of
Parliament for the City of London. The honour
of being the first Jew in that body could not induce
him to swear his allegiance "on the true faith of a
Christian," and on the New Testament. He remained
out of his seat for eleven years--and with him David
Salomons, who paid the penalty of £500 for voting in
the House without being duly sworn--when Parliament
yielded to men who did not yield, and the oath
was changed for Jews.

It has sometimes excited wonder why this wanderer
among the races, uncompromising amid the hatred of
ages, was not exterminated. It must often have
appeared to them that, like the bush in their own
legend, they were burnt without being consumed,
because their God was in the bush. But no miraculous
force need be sought in the case, nor any exceptional
tenacity of life in them as a race; their circumstances
developed in them special faculties adapted to
the commerce and civilisation of the world. Heine
said truly "the Jews were legally condemned to
become rich." The populace generally believed that
Jewish wealth was got from the Devil, their wages for
maintaining the kingdom of Antichrist in the world.
The Jewish banker, Samuel Bernard, who died in
1789, leaving a large property, had a black cock which
was popularly believed to be connected with his
wealth. The suspicion was confirmed when the bird
died a day or two before its master.

As a matter of fact the Jews were driven to deal in
money and jewellery--a word supposed by some to be
derived from "Jew"--by the general exclusion of
them from the possession of land and from the acquisition
of property by handicraft. Gold and silver
alone were left for their enterprise.

And there were good causes why they amassed
wealth. The first was that they did not spend it on
Gentile baubles. They cared not for the pomps and
luxuries of a world to which they did not belong.
Why then did they want to accumulate it? Why
were they so thrifty and unwearied in their pursuit of
gold? To ascribe this to avarice is to accept a popular
fallacy refuted by the history of that people, who are
even lavish in their charities and in their support of
public enterprises (as in England and America) where
they are free and equal citizens. In their earlier days
the Jews' hope of recovering their country and re-establishing
their Theocracy under the Messiah was a
passionate aspiration, it was as sincere as any
patriotism; every Jew held his wealth and his life as a
trust for that end. All their wealth they hoped one
day to lay at the Messiah's feet. So it began, and
then a new factor re-enforced it. The wealth of the
Jews became the main means of their survival as a
people. Kings and Popes protected them for the
money they could get out of them. But for this they
would certainly have been exterminated. From them
chiefly was extorted the money for Henry the Second's
Crusade in their own Holy Land. Mainly by their
labour and wealth Westminster Abbey was built.
By such protective extortions there was established a
certain force of natural selection and evolution, based
on their wealth, which gradually made them the
financial princes of Europe and bankers of the
world.

Whatever German bigots may say, the financial
supremacy of the Jews has been well and wisely exercised.
The nations not included under it have fared
according to their folly. When Queen Isabella of old
wished to protect the Jews because of such advantages,
she was confronted by the fanatic who said, "Judas sold
his Lord for thirty pieces of silver; will you sell Him for
thirty millions?" So the Jews suffered in Spain; but
what did Spain suffer? What did Holland and
England gain by the Spanish Jews, first tolerated,
then welcomed in their cities? This Germany will be
able to answer if the jealous bigots there let loose on
the Jews should succeed in driving them out of the
country.

"Thou, O Daniel, shut up the words and seal the
book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to
and fro, and knowledge shall be increased." So early
did the compulsory tendencies of the Jews reveal
themselves. Their alienation among other peoples
made them close up in their ceremonial law as in a
shell; their book was sealed amid inferior 'revelations'
swarming around them, and themselves sealed in it:
but, meanwhile, detached from the soil and the guilds
of every country, forced to be exchangers, pedlars,
they must travel to and fro, and their knowledge was
increased. They became so well acquainted with the
lore of different lands, with the medical and other
knowledge of various countries, that they were supposed
to possess occult powers. Occasionally, this
reputation might be of service to them, as in the instance
where Queen Elizabeth employed a Jewish
physician for his supposed occult knowledge; but
more often it harmed them, as in the evil fate that
overtook that same physician, whom jealous rivals
accused of an attempt to poison the Queen. For
many centuries they presented the most remarkable
instance of a people who had largely outgrown their
primitive superstitions, and acquired a religious and
intellectual enlightenment beyond the rest of the world,
who yet kept all this culture within the hard walls of
their barbaric stronghold, their ancient forms and
formulas, from which they did not dare to venture.




XIII.

THE POUND OF FLESH.


Passing out of Rome by the Via Appia, one comes
to many places of antiquarian interest, but presently
arrives at a spot whose significance increases with
time. This is the church called <i>Domine quo vadis</i>.
There, says the legend, St. Peter, once more flying
from danger, met Jesus, and said, "Lord, whither
goest thou?" Jesus answered, '<i>Venio Romam iterum
crucifigi.</i>' Whereupon Peter returned, and met his
fate--that hard one of a mythical martyrdom, followed
by resurrection as a Pontifical Jupiter, wielding
his keys as thunderbolts. A fac-simile of the holy
footprints of Jesus is here in the church, the originals,
sunk in marble, being preserved in Saint Sebastian's
Church.

Goethe had perhaps seen the worshippers around
these footprints (near by the Jewish catacomb with
its seven-branch candlestick), when there arose in him
the idea of a poem which, alas, never got farther than
the outline given in a further chapter. Writing from
Terni, October 27th, 1786, he says: "Yesterday I felt
inspired to undertake a work which at present would
be ill-timed. Approaching nearer and nearer to the
centre of Romanism, surrounded by Roman Catholics,
boxed up with a priest in a sedan, and striving
anxiously to observe and to study without prejudice
true nature and noble art, I have arrived at a vivid
conviction that all traces of original Christianity are
extinct here. Indeed, while I tried to bring it before
my mind in its purity, as we see it recorded in the
Acts of the Apostles, I could not help shuddering to
think of the shapeless, not to say grotesque, mass of
heathenism which heavily overlies its benign beginnings.
Accordingly, the 'Wandering Jew' again
occurred to me as having been a witness of all this
wonderful development and envelopment, and as
having lived to experience so strange a state of things,
that Christ himself, when he shall come a second time
to gather his harvest, will be in danger of being
crucified a second time. The legend <i>Venio iterum
crucifigi</i> was to serve me as the material of this
catastrophe."[30]

[Footnote 30: Morrison's translation (Bohn).]

Perhaps Goethe also witnessed "Holy-Cross Day"
in Rome, when the Jews were "compelled to come in"
and hear the annual sermon--"haled," as one said,
"as it were by the head and hair, and against their
obstinate hearts, to partake of the heavenly grace."
Had the two visionary Wanderers--Jesus and Ahasuerus--once
more encountered each other in sight
of the crosses, they could only have hung side by side;
he who gave the blow in Jerusalem, now conceivably
the one person in Rome able to recognise the freshly-crucified
from a cross of his own--the cross of his
race. From another poet have come the words which
typical Ahasuerus might, after the experience of so
many centuries, speak to the fellow-sufferer he once
had insulted:

/p
"Thou art the judge. We are bruised thus,
 But, the judgment over, join sides with us!
 Thine too is the cause! and not more Thine
 Than ours is the work of these dogs and swine,
 Whose life laughs through and spits at their creed,
 Who maintain Thee in word, and defy Thee in deed!

"We withstood Christ then? be mindful how,
 At least we withstand Barabbas now!
 Was our outrage sore? but the worst we spared.
 To have called these--Christians, had we dared!
 Let defiance of them pay mistrust of Thee,
 And Rome make amends for Calvary!

"By the torture prolonged from age to age,
 By the infamy, Israel's heritage,
 By the Ghetto's plague, by the garb's disgrace.
 By the badge of shame, by the felon's place,
 By the branding tool, the bloody whip,
 And the summons to Christian fellowship--

"We boast our proof that at least the Jew,
 Would wrest Christ's name from the Devil's crew
 Thy face took never so deep a shade,
 But we fought them in it, God our aid!
 A trophy to bear, as we march, Thy band,
 South, east, and on to the Pleasant Land!"[31]
p/

[Footnote 31: Robert Browning: "Holy-Cross Day."]

Holy-Cross Day was appropriate for this work of
striking the Jewish race in the face, as they fainted at
the Christian door, and showing them now themselves
the crucified, by a High Priest Christ taught to hate
his enemies and pierce them with nail and spear.
For it was about the time of the alleged discovery of
the True Cross, already noticed, that this fable of the
Wandering Jew probably first began its career.[32]
Already at that time it was shown on the walls of imperial
Christendom that Jesus and Ahasuerus, as types
of Humanity, had changed places--the nails and the
thorn-crown transferred from one to the other; and,
what is more, the cruel dogmas and superstitions
abandoned by the one made by the other into the
established religion of Europe.

[Footnote 32: "Quel est donc l'origine et la date de cette légende? Je la
crois, comme celle du voile de sainte Véronique et généralement
comme toutes les histoires relatives à la Passion, née vers le
quatrième siècle, à Constantinople, et contemporaine de sainte
Hélène et de la découverte de la vraie croix. Mais ces traditions
sont restées longtemps orales."--<i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>,
Dec. 1, 1833. Published as introduction to Quinet's "Ahasuerus."
Goethe connects Saint Veronica with Ahasuerus in the plan of
his intended work elsewhere given. Veronica, whose name
means the <i>true portrait</i> (<i>i.e.</i> of Christ which was retained on the
apron with which she wiped the sweat from his face), would be
a natural counterpart of the man who refused all succour to the
fainting sufferer. In enthusiasm about the <i>true cross</i> might be
born a myth of the <i>true image</i>, and of a "witness" to both.]

In the familiar legend of the True Cross, Helena
is for a time baffled by a certain Judas, who has
occult sources of knowledge, and warns the Jews that
the empress is coming to find what, if found, will
cause the downfall of their religion. But she having
threatened a general massacre, the Jews inform her
that this Judas can alone reveal the place of the
cross. He refuses; is starved at the bottom of a dry
well for six days; on the seventh, consents. When
the cross appears, Judas is converted by its miracles
and baptized.

In a paper read to the New Shakspeare Society,
April 9th, 1875, Miss Toulmin Smith announced her
discovery that the story of the "Pound of Flesh" is
contained in the thirteenth century English poem,
"<i>Cursor Mundi</i>," there interwoven with the legend of the
Finding of the Holy Cross. A Christian goldsmith,
in the service of Queen Helena, owes a sum of money
to a Jew; if he cannot pay it at a certain time he is
to render the weight of the wanting money in his own
flesh. The bond is forfeit; the Jew prepares to cut
the flesh; but the judges decide that no drop of blood
must be shed. The Jew being thus defeated, Queen
Helena declares that he must give up all his goods to
the State and lose his tongue. This sentence is
remitted on his agreeing to tell her where the Holy
Cross is hidden,--which he did.

It might easily arise, as a saga on this Jew's knowledge,
that he had personally participated in the hiding
of the Cross, just after the crucifixion, and had been
miraculously preserved through centuries as "a witness"
to reveal its place of concealment, and thereby also to
be "a witness" to the truth of the Christian legend.
This might even have been in the minds of those who
gave him the name of Judas, though perhaps that is
merely a token of homage to the True Cross, as potent
enough to convert a Judas. It is in harmony with
the endless plots and counterplots of the True Cross
Tale that the traitor of Christ should live to become
traitor to Antichrist. At the same time there is a
suggestion in it of precise retribution in kind which
naturally combines with the story of the "Pound of
Flesh." It is highly probable that Shylock and the
Eternal Jew are twins of the True Cross Mythology,
though Ahasuerus be a later name and figure.

But this Holy Cross itself was, and is, a perpetual
symbol of the pound-of-flesh principle which lay at
the foundation of the ancient Jewish system, and from
it, after that foundation had crumbled for the Jews,
was adopted as the chief corner-stone of Christianity.
This I have demonstrated elsewhere,[33] and the history
of the legend, with the conclusions based on it, though
they may appear here as an episode, will be found
closely related to the development of our subject.

[Footnote 33: <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, May, 1880.]

Mr. Swinburne speaks of Marlowe's Jew as the real
man, while Shakspeare's is a mouthpiece for the
finest poetry.[34] A surprising criticism! The genesis
of the conventional stage-Jew in England has already
been given in this work (XI.), and my reader will do
well to refer to it at this point.

[Footnote 34: "<i>Study of Shakspeare.</i>" (Chatto and Windus.)]

It is sufficiently remarkable that, in this year 1881,
London should have witnessed on the stage, as acted
by two eminent Shakspeare interpreters, the two
stage-Jews which competed for popular favour in the
time of Marlowe and Shakspeare. The "Shylock" of
Mr. Booth is an odious, avaricious, bloodthirsty villain;
that of Mr. Irving is a fatal, powerful and pathetic
character. The fine acting of Mr. Booth cannot strive
against the art of Shakspeare, who at no point could
have raised sympathy with a man he meant should be
utterly repulsive. Mr. Booth's personation rests too
much on the traditional make-up of Shylock, which
is really that of Barabas. When Edmund Kean, as
a poor unknown actor, first went to play Shylock at
Drury Lane, he raised some laughter behind the
scenes by taking from his small bundle a black wig!
Black it was, not red; human, not diabolic: the
smiling company said, "<i>That</i> will be a failure"; but
it was not. One after another the outside traits of
Shylock, costume borrowed from Barabas, have disappeared;
not a word of Shakspeare's text has had to
disappear with them; the character which the poet
conceived has been largely unsheathed by Mr.
Irving.

We know that no such figure as that at the Lyceum
appeared on Shakspeare's own stage at the Globe.
Shylock, as acted by Shakspeare's friend Burbage,
was a comic figure. His make-up consisted of exceedingly
red hair and beard, a false nose preternaturally
long and hooked, and a tawny petticoat.
Such a figure must have been largely meant to make
fun for the pit and gallery, of which Shakspeare was
rarely oblivious, and Burbage never.

But a conventional stage-figure is generally an
evolution, and this farcical Shylock was no exception.
The famous Isaac of Norwich was a typical Jew in
his time. A thirteenth century caricature, preserved
in the Pell Office, shows us the popular notion of him.
He is pictured as a three-faced idol surrounded by
devils. The three faces are not especially ugly or
comical, but repulsive enough; and we may detect in
the figure the reflection of a period when the diabolical
theory of the Jew was serious, and no laughing
matter. Similarly, in the old Miracle Plays, Satan
was a serious figure, though he gradually became a
mere laughing-stock, like Pantaloon in the pantomimes.
The stage-Jew shared the same decline as the stage-devil--his
supposed inspirer. In his malignant and
formidable aspect he was, indeed, in Shakspeare's
day, the main figure of Marlowe's popular play; but
even he had the long nose and sundry grotesque
features; and it can hardly be doubted that, in the
still more ludicrous make-up of Shylock, the Globe
Theatre followed the popular feeling.

Perhaps there may be hidden in the name Shylock
the idea of a lock-shearer, shaver of the last hair
from his victim; at any rate "the shearer sheared"
would include the whole significance of the story
which Shakspeare took in hand. In the character
of Shylock, he retained the grotesquerie which might
please the rabble, at the same time turning their scowl
to laughter. Even now, while Mr. Irving is giving
his pathetic impersonation, the occasional laugh reminds
us how easily some parts of the text would
lend themselves to a farcical interpretation, if the
painted nose and comic gestures were present. But
it is more remarkable to observe how rare and superficial
are these ludicrous incidents. The farcical
Shylock has passed away from the English stage
through force of the more real character which
Shakspeare drew. Shakspeare may not have intended
all the far-reaching moral belonging to the
ancient legend of the pound of flesh, but surely no one
can carefully compare his Shylock with the Barabas
of his contemporary without recognising a purpose to
modify and soften the popular feeling towards the
Jew, to picture a man where Marlowe had painted a
monster, if not indeed to mirror for Christians their
own injustice and cruelty.

Let us take our stand beside Portia when she summons
the Merchant and Shylock to stand forth. The
two men have long legendary antecedents and have
met many times before. There are eleven versions of
the bond story in the early literature of Europe. In
four of these versions no Jew appears. Karl Simrock
believes that it is an ancient law-anecdote--an illustration
of the law of retaliation pressed to an extreme.
The evidences he gives of its use for this purpose are
interesting, and it appears to me probable that it
might have been in this way that the Jew was first
introduced into the story. Where a Jew and a Christian
confronted each other in any issue it might be
assumed that all mitigations of the <i>summum jus</i> were
removed from the question; only the naked technical
terms of the law could then be conceived as restraining
either from doing the utmost injury he could to the
other. There is an old Persian version of the tale, in
which, perhaps for a similar reason, a Moslem and an
Armenian confront each other; and in this case the
failure of the bond is not because of the blood, but
because of the extreme exactness of weight demanded
by the court. An Egyptian form of the story has a
similar end.

Side by side, in all ages and races, have struggled
with each other the principle of Retaliation and that of
Forgiveness. In religion the vindictive principle has
euphemistic names: it is called law and justice. The
other principle, that of remission, has had to exist by
sufferance, and in nearly all religions has been recognised
only in subordinate alliance with its antagonist.
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, blood for blood,
is primitive law. Projected into heaven, magnified in
the divine majesty, it becomes the principle that a
deity cannot be just and yet a justifier of offenders.
"Without the shedding of blood there is no remission
of sins." Since finite man is naturally assumed to be
incapable of directly satisfying an infinite law, all
religions, based on the idea of a divine lawgiver, are
employed in devising schemes by which commutations
may be secured and vicarious satisfactions of divine law
obtained. Nature never forgives. No deity inferred
from the always relentless forces of nature has ever
been supposed able to forgive the smallest sin until it
was exactly atoned for. For this reason the divine
mercifulness has generally become a separate personification.
The story of the "Pound of Flesh" is one of the
earliest fables concerning these conflicting principles.

The following legend was related to me by a Hindu,
as one he had been told in his childhood. The chief
of the Indian triad, Indra, pursued the god Agni.
Agni changed himself to a dove in order to escape;
but Indra changed himself to a hawk, to continue the
pursuit. The dove took refuge with Vishnu, second
person of the triad, the Hindu Saviour. Indra flying
up, demanded the dove; Vishnu, concealing it in his
bosom, refused to give up the dove. Indra then took
an oath that if the dove were not surrendered he
would tear from Vishnu's breast an amount of flesh
equal to the body of the dove. Vishnu still refused to
surrender the bird, but bared his breast. The divine
hawk tore from it the exact quantity, and the drops of
blood--the blood of a Saviour--as they fell to the
ground wrote the scriptures of the Vedas.

Among the various versions of this story in India I
have not been able to find any in accepted sacred
books preserving with the simplicity of this folk-tale
the ancient moral antagonism between the deities afterwards
found in alliance as a triad. Hindu orthodoxy
has outgrown the phase of faith which could sanction
that probably provincial legend. Its spirit survives in
one of Vishnu's titles, Yadjña Varâha, "the boar of
sacrifice," derived from Vishnu's third incarnation, by
which he saved the world from demons by becoming
himself a victim. We may see in the fable reflection
of a sacrificial age, an age in which the will and word
of a god became inexorable fate, but also the dawning
conception of a divineness in the mitigation of the
law, which ultimately adds saving man-gods or demi-gods
to nature-gods that cannot be appeased.

The earliest version, probably <sc>B.C.</sc> 300, is the story
in the Mahábhárata (<i>Vana parva</i>) of the trial of the
best of mankind, King Usinára. Indra and Agni,
wishing to test his fidelity to the laws of righteousness,
assume the forms of falcon and pigeon. The
latter (Agni) pursued by the former (Indra) seeks and
receives the king's protection. The falcon demands
the pigeon, and is refused on the ground that it is
written that to kill a twice-born man, to kill a cow,
and to abandon a being that has taken refuge with
one, are equal sins. This is a quotation from the
Laws of Manu. The falcon argues that it is the law
of nature that it shall feed on pigeons, and a statute
against nature is no law. He (the falcon) will be
starved, consequently his mate and little ones must
perish, and thus in preserving one the king will slay
many. The falcon is offered by Usinára other food--a
boar, bull, gazelle--but the falcon declares that it is
not the law of its nature to eat such things. The
king then declares that he will not give up the pigeon,
but he will give anything else in his power which the
falcon may demand. The falcon replies that he can
only accept a quantity of the king's own flesh equal in
weight to the pigeon's body. Usinára gladly accedes
to this substitution. Balances are produced, and the
pigeon is placed in one scale. The king cuts off a
piece of his flesh that appears large enough, but is insufficient;
he cuts again and again, but still the
pigeon outweighs his piled-up flesh. Finally, all his
flesh gone, the king gets into the scale himself. The
two gods then resume their divine shape, announce to
Usinára that for the sacrifice he has made he will be
glorified in all worlds throughout eternity, and the
king ascends transfigured into heaven.

This legend is repeated under the title <i>Syena-Kapotiyam</i>
(Dove and Hawk) in the <i>Parana Sarvasvan</i> in
the Bodleian Library, where it is in Bengali characters.
There is another version in the <i>Markandêyâ
Purâna</i> (ch. iii.), in which Indra appears to the sage
Vipulasvan in the form of a large famished bird.
Finding that this bird can only be nourished by
human flesh, the sage appeals to his sons to give it
some of their flesh; and on their refusal he curses
them, and tells the bird that after he has performed
certain funeral ceremonies his body shall be for its
nourishment. Whereupon Indra bids the sage abandon
his body only by the power of contemplation, reveals
his divine nature, and offers Vipulasvan whatever he
may ask.

Indra here says, "I eat no living creature," which
shows a moral advance. Perhaps his conversion may
have been in some measure due to the teaching of
Buddha. It is instructive to compare the Mahábhárata
legend with an early Buddhist version cited by
M. Focaux from the <i>Dsang-loung</i>,[35] a version all the
more significant because the hero of it, Sivi, was traditionally
the son of Usinára and had already appeared
in the fourth book of Mahábhárata as tried in the
same way with his father, and with the same results.
Sivi had become a popular type of self-sacrifice.
According to the Buddhist legend, Indra, perceiving
that his divine existence was drawing to a close, confided
to Visvakarman[36] his grief at not seeing in the
world any man who would become a Buddha. Visvakarman
declared King Sivi such a man. The falcon
and pigeon test is then applied. But the Buddhist
Sivi does not, like his Brahman prototype, offer to
compensate the falcon with the flesh of other animals.
He agrees to give his own flesh. The gods descend
and weep tears of emotion at seeing the king as a
skeleton outweighing the dove which all of his flesh
could not equal. Nor is the Buddhist saint caught up to
heaven. He is offered the empire and throne of Indra
himself, but refuses it; he desires only to be a Buddha.
Sivi's body is restored to greater beauty than before,
and he becomes the Buddha amid universal joy.

[Footnote 35: <i>Le Mahabarata</i>, p. 241.]

[Footnote 36: The 'omnificent,' who offered up all worlds in a general
sacrifice, and ended by sacrificing himself.]

Other versions show the legend further detached
from brahmanic ideas, and resting more completely
upon Buddha's compassionateness to all creatures.
Of this description is one in the "Sermons" by
Asphagosha, for the translation of which I am indebted
to Professor Beal. Sakra (a name of Indra)
tempted by a heretic to believe that the teaching of
Buddha was false, and that men followed it from
motives of self-interest, sought for a perfect man who
was practising austerities solely for the sake of becoming
a Buddha. Finding one, Sivaka Raja, he agreed
with Visvakarman to tempt him. All happens as in
the old legend, except that Sivaka rests his refusal
not upon the law of Manu, nor upon the sanctity of
asylum, but upon his love of all living things. To this
his mercifulness the falcon appeals, reminding him of
its own young, and Sivaka calls for a knife and cuts
off a piece of his flesh, not caring whether it is more
or less than the body of the dove. He then faints.
All living creatures raise lamentations, and the deities,
much affected, heal the wound.

The influence of Buddhism is traceable in the
modifications of the original legend, which show the
sacrifice not accepted as it was in the case of Vishnu,
and to some extent in that of Usinára, whose earthly
life terminates. With Buddha the principle of remission
supersedes that of sacrifice. His argument
against the Brahmanic sacrifice of life was strong.
When they pointed to these predatory laws of nature
in proof of their faith that the gods approved the infliction
of pain and death, he asked them why they did
not sacrifice their own children; why they did not offer
to the gods the most valuable lives. The fact was that
they were outgrowing direct human sacrifices--preserving
self-mortifications--and animals were slain in
commutation of costlier offerings. This moral revolution
is traceable in the gradual constitution of Vishnu
as a Saviour. There is a later legend that Vishnu
approached Sivi in the form of a Brahman in want of
food, but would accept none except the flesh of Sivi's
son Vrihad-Garbha. The king killed and cooked his
son and placed the food before the Brahman, who
then bade him eat it himself. Sivi prepared to do so,
when Vishnu stayed his hand, revealed himself, restored
the son to life, and vanished. This legend belongs
to a transitional period. Its outcome is found
in several Hindu folk-tales, one of which has been
told by the charming story-teller, Mr. W. R. S.
Ralston. The king of a country is dying, and a poor
man is informed of the fact by a disguised "fate."
He asks if there is no way to save the king's life, and
is told there is but one way; if a child should be
sacrificed, with its own consent, that would save the
king. The man returns home and proposes to his
wife to slay their beautiful little boy. She consents;
the boy having also consented, the knife is about to
descend on the child, when the fates appear, announcing
that they only wished to try his loyalty to
his king, who had already recovered.

We may feel pretty certain that originally that king
was a deity, though not so certain that the knife was
arrested without killing anything at all. In several
popular fables we find the story preserved essentially
in the old sacrificial form, to teach the rewards of self-sacrifice,
though, in order to escape the scandal of a
human sacrifice, the self-devotion is ascribed to
animals. Thus, in the <i>Panchatantra</i>, a pigeon roasts
itself to save a famished bird-catcher, who had just
captured his mate; and the bird-catcher presently
seeing its radiant form rising to heaven, spends his
life consuming his flesh in the fire of devotion, in
order that he also may ascend there.

In the Hebrew story corresponding to that of
Vishnu and Sivi, the Hindu Abraham, we may see
that where a god is concerned the actual sacrifice cannot
be omitted. That may do in the case of a dying
king or hungry hawk, but not for a deity. In the case
of Abraham and Isaac the demand is not remitted
but commuted. The ram is accepted instead of Isaac.
But even so much concession could hardly be recognized
by the Hebrew priesthood as an allowable
variation from a direct demand of Jahve, and so the
command is said to have been given by Elohim, its
modification by Jahve. The cautious transformation
is somewhat in the spirit of the disguises of the Aryan
deities, who may partially revoke as gods the orders
they gave as hawks. It would indicate a more advanced
idea if we found Jahve remitting a claim of his
own instead of one made by the Elohim.

It is worthy of a remark that in some regions where
this change of names in the story of Abraham's
sacrifice is overlooked or unknown by Semitic religionists,
there has sprung up a tradition that the
sacrifice was completed, and the patriarch's son
miraculously restored to life. Thus, in another branch
of the Jewish religion we find Mohammed flinching at
the Biblical story. He does not like to admit that
Allah altered his word and purpose except for a
serious consideration, so he says, "We ransomed him
with a noble victim." The Moslems believe that Isaac
was not then born, and that it was Ishmael across
whose throat Abraham actually drew the knife, which
was miraculously kept from killing the lad, according
to some, but others say resulted in a death and
resurrection.

In the year 1879 the highly educated State of
Massachusetts was thrilled with horror by the tidings
that a man named Freeman had offered up his beautiful
and only child, Edith Freeman, as a sacrifice to
God. It occurred in the historical town of Pocasset. A
thousand years ago the Northmen who first discovered
America wintered there, and possibly they there
offered human sacrifices to their god Odin--that is, if
they got hold of one or two red men; for there has
been a notable tendency among men in such cases to
prefer other victims than themselves for their gods.
Since that first landing of white men in America the
religion of Odin had yielded to that of Christ; Pocasset
and all New England had been converted to
Christianity; the Bible had found its way into every
home. Yet this well-to-do citizen, Mr. Freeman,
and his wife, had learned in Sunday School about
Abraham's touching proof of his faith. They had
pondered the lesson until they heard the voice of
Abraham's God summoning them to a similar sacrifice,
and they committed a deed which probably would
have shocked even those rude Vikings who wintered
at Pocasset a thousand years before. So much might
the worship of a pitiless primitive deity arrest the
civilisation of a household in the land of Channing
and Parker. They prayed over the little girl, then the
knife was plunged into her heart. Little Edith is now
in her grave. The God of Abraham and Isaac got
his pound of flesh this time. The devout priest of that
horrible altar has just passed from his prison to an
asylum. To the many who have visited him he puts
questions hard to be answered. "Do you believe the
Bible or not?" he says. "If you do, and have read
the account of Abraham, why should you deny that
God could require a man to sacrifice his child? He
so required of me. I <i>did</i> hope and believe that he
would stay my hand before the blow fell. When he
did not I still believed he would raise my child to life.
But that is his own affair. I have given that which I
loved most to God because He commanded me."
The American people waited to see whether a Christian
community which trains up children to admire the
faith of Abraham would hang them when they grow
up to imitate that faith so impressed upon them.
The embarrassing dilemma was escaped after eight
months, by getting Freeman into an asylum for the
insane, without trial. A rather mean way of confessing
that theocratic piety is republican insanity!

I observed, soon after the occurrence of this tragedy,
a picture of it in the <i>Police News</i> exposed in the shop
windows of London. The designer had placed a crucifix
near the little victim's head. It is probable that Freeman
and his wife never saw a crucifix in their lives;
they belong to the hardest, baldest dogmatic Protestantism.
The rude artist perhaps placed the crucifix
in his picture because the Abrahamic sacrifice was
supposed to be typical of a holier one--a sacrifice in
which a Son was offered up to satisfy the fatal law of
a Father. In the human sacrifice symbolised by that
crucifix culminated all these sacrifices of which mention
has been made; and there was embodied that
principle which has maintained through the ages that
though to forgive may be human, to avenge is divine.

Let us return now to Shylock and the Merchant
whose life is forfeit. Shylock is a primæval Jew; he
represents the law, the letter and rigour of it. He is
Indra tearing Vishnu's breast; Elohim demanding
Isaac's death; the First Person exacting the Second
Person's atoning blood. His bond, his oath registered
in heaven, its sanction by Venetian law, are by him
identified with eternal justice. It is the irrevocable
"thing spoken," <i>fatum</i>, weird, or word. Portia is
exact in telling him that he represents that "justice"
in whose course, "none of us should see salvation."
The Jew personates his ancient god precisely. Nor
is there wanting a certain majesty in his position. There
is nothing mean about Shylock now, whatever there may
have been at first. He has been called avaricious.
But, as we have already seen (XII.), the wealth of the
Jews was the main factor in their survival. There is,
indeed, an illustration of this in the only version of
the Bond legend which makes any pretension to be
considered historical. A Jew named Cenéda forfeited
a pound of his flesh to a Christian merchant, on a
wager; the case was brought before the Pope,
Sixtus V., who decided that the Christian must pay
two thousand scudi to his treasury for attempting
manslaughter, and the Jew pay in an equal sum for
having hazarded his life, that being a taxable property
belonging to the Pope. Balzac tells us of a
mediæval seneschal in France who declared the Jews
to be the best taxgatherers in his region. It was his
custom to let them gain money as bees collect honey:
then he would swoop down on their hive and take
it all away. The Jews were driven by oppressive
statutes to the dealings in money which brought
opprobrium upon them; and in hating Antonio
because he lent money without interest, and so
lowered the rate of usance in Venice, Shylock was
hating him for undermining the existence of his tribe.
Shylock scorns thrice his principal. For now he has
been summoned by his own woes, the taking away of
his daughter and his property, including that ring
mourned because given by his lost Leah--artfully
contrasted with the surrender by the Christian lovers
of the rings they had vowed never to part with--to
stand forth as an avenger of the ages of wrong heaped
upon his race. That is an Elohistic moment for
Shylock, and ducats become dross in its presence.
When the full tidings of his woes and wrongs are told
him he cries, "The curse never fell upon our nation
till now: I never felt it till now." Thenceforth we
may see in Shylock the impersonation of the divine
avenger of a divinely chosen people, and the majesty
of his law confronting an Edomite world.

On the other hand stands Antonio, representing
rather feebly, until he too is summoned from being a
mere rich merchant to become a shorn victim, the
opposite principle. He stands for the Christ, the
Forgiver, the Sufferer. In the course of its travels
the legend had combined with one told by Hyginus.
The patriot Moros having conspired to rid his country
of its tyrant, falls into the hands of that tyrant, Dionysius
of Sicily, who orders him to be crucified. But
Moros is allowed a respite and absence of three days
to visit his sister, his friend Selenuntius having agreed
to become his hostage. On his way back, Moros is
impeded by a swollen river, and when he reaches the
place of execution finds his friend on the point of
being nailed to the cross. The two friends now insist
each on being crucified for the other, at which sight
Dionysius is so affected that he releases both, resolves
to be a more humane king, and asks the friends to
take him as "the third in their bond of friendship."
It is remarkable that this legend (which suggested to
Schiller his ballad <i>Die Bürgschaft</i>, the Suretyship)
should have been a popular one at the beginning of
the Christian era, introducing as it does an exactor of
vicarious suffering--that too by a cross--and ending
with the tyrant becoming one in a trinity of friendship.

Shakespeare has brought this vicarious feature into
a prominence it never had in any version he could
ever have seen, and his art, creating as it must in
organic consistency, has dramatised the psychological
history of mankind.

Antonio, the merchant called on to suffer, is the
man who gained nothing at all from the bond. He
has incurred the danger and penalty in order that his
rather worthless friend Bassanio may get the money
necessary to secure a rich marriage which shall free
him from his debts. It is the just suffering for the
unjust. Antonio is the man who gives, hoping for
nothing again; in low simplicity he lends out money
gratis; and, when Shylock agrees to lend the three
thousand ducats, the merchant says, "This Hebrew
will turn Christian; he grows kind." At the trial,
Antonio speaks like the predestined victim:

/p
I am a tainted wether of the flock,
Meetest for death.
p/

And, when the trial is over, Antonio is the only man
who offers to relax his hold on the Jew's property. He
gives up his own half, and takes the other only to give
it away to Shylock's daughter and her husband.

To be kind Antonio calls Christian; but it was not
that spirit which finally brought Shylock into the
same fold with his judges. His life is spared on
condition of his becoming a Christian. Professor
Morley and other critics say that was harsh. But
Shylock is no longer a genuine Jew, and Shakespeare
properly relieves that race of his connection. The
Jews had indeed, in primitive ages, begun with the
eye-for-an-eye principle, but fiery trials had long
taught them patience under injury. Shylock, reminding
Antonio, when he asks help, of his outrages, says:

/p
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
p/

So had it been for many ages, and the Jew had relegated
the principle of vengeance to his fossil theology,
practically becoming the patient victim; while, on the
other hand, Christianity, reaching the throne, had
antiquated Christ's principle of mercy, and was
dealing out the rigours of the Judaic law which Israel
had outgrown by suffering. Shylock had grandly
asserted the humanity of the Jew, in the first words of
that kind ever heard in Europe; but he had gone on
to assert his <i>Christianized</i> nature. "If we are like
you in the rest, we will be like you in that. If a Jew
wrong a Christian, what is his humility? revenge; if
a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance
be by Christian example? why, revenge. The villainy
you teach me I will execute." But when Shylock
thus repairs back to the old eye-for-an-eye spirit, when
he draws from the armoury of the ancient law the old
weapon of retaliation, it is only to find that the
sacrificial knife grown rusty for a Jew is bright and
keen enough in Christian hands. In pressing to
practise the blood-atonement and vicarious principle
he enters upon Christian ground, and Shakspeare
rightly baptizes him a Christian.

We may naturally question whether Shakspeare
meant this irony. Did he intend any subtle hit when
he made these Christians claim as a co-religionist,
ripe for baptism, a man who had just attempted to
take a fellow-man's life? That cannot be affirmed;
but it is notable that there should be in the play
another passage liable to that construction. Shylock's
enemies have just converted his daughter Jessica into
a good Christian; and the first sign of the work of
grace in her heart is the facility with which she steals
and squanders her father's money. Shakspeare does
not fail to connect with this pious robbery the
Christian customs of the time towards Jews. When
the robbery and elopement have been planned, the
Jew's Christian servant, Lancelot, says to Jessica:

/p
There will come a Christian by
Will be worth a Jewess' eye.
p/

That seems to be a play upon the then familiar
phrase "worth a Jew's eye"--a Jew having often to
pay an enormous sum in order to avoid having his
eye put out. With that Christian usage the poet
apparently connects the robbery of Shylock's treasure.
So by adopting the Christian usage of the time, by
saying to Antonio what King John said to the Jews--"Your
money or your flesh"--Shylock had given
evidence of a change of heart, and his right place was
in the Christian fold.

But among all these representative figures of the
Venetian court-room, transformations from the flying
doves and pursuing hawks, bound victims and exacting
deities of ancient mythology, there is one who
possesses a significance yet to be considered. That is
Portia. Who is this gentle woman in judicial
costume? She is that human heart which in every
age, amid hard dogmatic systems and priestly intolerance,
has steadily appealed against the whole
vindictive system--whether Jewish or Christian--and,
even while outwardly conforming, managed to rescue
human love and virtue from it. With his wonted yet
ever-marvellous felicity, Shakspeare has made the
genius of this human sentiment slipping through the
technicalities of priest-made law a woman. In the
mythology of dooms and spells it is often that by the
seed of the woman they are broken: the Prince must
remain a Bear till Beauty shall offer to be his bride;
the Flying Dutchman shall find repose if a maiden
shall voluntarily share his sorrow. It is, indeed
the woman-soul which has silently veiled the
rude hereditary gods and laws of barbarism--the
pitiless ones--with a host of gentle saints and intercessors,
until the heartless systems have been left to
theologians. Inside the frowning buttresses of
dogmatic theology the heart of woman has built up
for the home a religion of sympathy and charity.

Portia does not argue against the technique of the
law. She agrees to call the old system justice--so
much the worse for justice. In the outcome she
shows that this so-called justice is no justice at all.
And when she has shown that the letter of "justice"
kills, and warned Shylock that he can be saved from
the fatal principle he has raised only by the spirit
that gives life, she is out of the case, save for a
last effort to save him from the blind law he has invoked.
The Jew now sues before a Christian Shylock.
And Portia--like Mary, and all sweet interceding
spirits that ever softened stern gods in human hope--turns
from the judicial Jahves of the bench to the
one forgiving spirit there. "What mercy can you
render him, Antonio?" The Christian Gratiano interposes,
"A halter gratis: nothing else, for God's
sake." A natural appeal for the victim-loving God;
but the forgiving Christ is heard, however faintly, above
the Christian, and Antonio forgives his part of Shylock's
penalty.

"Vengeance is mine," says the deity derived by
fear from the remorseless course of sun and star, ebb
and flow, frost and fire. Forgiveness is the attribute
of man. We may reverse Portia's statement, and say
that, instead of Mercy dropping as the gentle rain
from heaven, it is projected into heaven from compassionate
human hearts beneath. And heavenly power
doth then show likest man's when mercy seasons the
vengeance of nature. From the wild forces above not
only droppeth gentle rain, but thunder and lightning,
famine and pestilence; it is man with his lightning-rod,
his sympathy, his healing art, who turns them
from their path and interposes a shield from their
fury. When, as the two walked together in the night,
Leigh Hunt looked up to the heaven of stars, and
said, "God, the Beautiful," Carlyle looked, and said,
"God, the Terrible." It was the ancient worshipper
of the Laws of Nature beside Abou ben Adhem, who
loving not the Lord, yet loved his fellow men, and sees
a human sweetness in the stars. All religions, beginning
with trembling sacrifices to elemental powers personified--powers
that never forgive--end with the worship of
an ideal man, the human lover and Saviour. That
evolution is invariable. Criticism may find this or
that particular deified man limited and imperfect, and
may discard him. It may take refuge in pure theism,
as it is called. But it amounts to the same thing.
What it worships is still a man--an invisible, vast
man, but still a man. To worship eternal love,
supreme wisdom, ideal moral perfection, is still to
worship man, for we know such attributes only in
man. Therefore the Shylock-principle is non-human
nature, hard natural law moving remorselessly on its
path from cause to effect; the Portia-principle, the
quality of Mercy, means the purely human religion,
which, albeit for a time using the terms of ancient
nature-worship and alloyed with its spirit, must be
steadily detached from these, and on the ruins of every
sacrificial altar and dogma build the temple whose
only services shall be man's service to man.




XIV.

THE WANDERING JEW IN FOLK-LORE.


In the East and South, beneath climes that suggest
an ideal paradise of repose or idle felicity, the undying
saints were represented as dwelling in enchanted
islands far from the toiling world, or slumbering in
secret grottoes, while those whose immortality was a
doom were compelled to roam restlessly over the
earth. But when these myths had migrated into the
active regions of Europe they were steadily transformed.
It was felt to be hardly a satisfactory
distribution of parts for the saintly immortals to be
sleeping or enjoying themselves with fairies while the
evil ones were so busy careering through earth and
air. So, gradually the saintly sleepers awake. The
Seven Sleepers sally forth as the Seven Champions
of Christendom. Joseph of Arimathea cannot lie
down in his sacred sepulchre which he had given for
the body of Jesus, and becomes a holy wanderer.
St. James emerges from the rock which had closed
around his body like soft wax, and leads Spain against
the Moors. St. John does not rest in his grotto at
Ephesus, but makes pilgrimages, on one of which he
asks alms of Edward the Confessor, near Westminster
Abbey, who gives to the mendicant a gold ring, afterwards
sent him from the East, with the saint's
benediction. St. Peter goes abroad also. When the
first Abbot of Westminster is about to be ordained in
the Abbey, St. Peter appears in the night, crosses the
Thames in a boat, himself ordains the Abbot, and
leaves a wondrous fish to convince the Archbishop
next day that the consecration has been performed,
rendering the future Deans of Westminster responsible
to Peter alone, and able to preach what heresies they
like, without episcopal interference. Popular superstition
is sometimes good-hearted, and liberated even
the sorcerer Merlin from his prison of air, as appears
in the lines of Southey:

/p
                    "In his crystal ark
Whither sail'd Merlin with his band of bards,
Old Merlin, master of the mystic lore;
Belike his crystal ark, instinct with life,
Obedient to the mighty Master, reached
The land of the Departed."[37]
p/

[Footnote 37: <i>Madoc</i>, xi. This, however, is contrary to Welsh orthodoxy.
I remember being present at a dinner-company in Wales, given
to Ralph Waldo Emerson, when a gentleman present was
sceptical enough to assure the eminent American that though
he had often passed the traditional spot of Merlin's aërial
prison, he had never heard any voice from the air, and did not
believe the story. Emerson answered: "You must be a bold
man."]

But while Merlin thus finds freedom again ending
in repose, Arthur comes forth from his subterranean
palace to lead the hunt, or from his Avalon to wing
his way in form of a raven.

Thus the doomed Wandering Jew, under whatever
name, finally found himself wandering in good company.
This opens the way for human compassion to
proffer those little mitigations of divine remorselessness
which, as they gradually appear in folk-lore,
are such severe, because unconscious, satires upon the
deity of theology. The sentence of the deity, or of
the sadly deified Jesus, once uttered cannot be
revoked; but the human heart is no such victim of
its own egotism or passionate impulse. Thus, Kuhn
(2, 32) mentions the belief in Westphalia that the Jew
may obtain a night's repose if there be left in a field
two harrows with the teeth downward. If one wishes
to do the god-like thing he must leave the teeth of
his harrow upward; then the Jew must wander on.
In some other regions of Germany (Wüttke, 759) the
Jew can find rest at any place where two oaks grow
together in such a way as to form a cross. In Oldenburg
it is said he can rest from the middle of May to
the end of July, which is also the time when the Wild
Huntsman may find repose. An old Metz picture
shows the Jew with Wodan's flying hair and mantle,
but with a kindly countenance. It is only in a recent
instance that anything diabolical has been associated
with him pictorially, this being in a Lorraine engraving
of 1842, where he has the hat and feather of Fra
Diavolo.

There is a tone of pity in the old verses which
spread abroad the fable in Flanders, and has thence
gone through many lands as <i>The Wandering Jew's
Complaint</i>, though with many variations. I find them
quoted in Mr. Hoffman's book, referred to elsewhere.
The burgesses of Brabant address the Wanderer:

/p
"We used to think your story
   Was but an idle dream;
 But when thus wan and hoary
   And broken down you seem,
 The sight can not deceive
 And we the tale believe.

"Are you that man of sorrow
   Of whom our authors write--
 Grief comes with every morrow,
   And wretchedness at night;
 Oh, let us know are you
 Isaac, the Wandering Jew?

"Then he replied, 'Believe me,
   I suffer bitter woe;
 Incessant travels grieve me--
   No rest's for me below;
 A respite I have never,
 But onward <sc>MARCH</sc> forever!

"'Twas by my rash behaviour
   I wrought this fearful scathe:
 As Christ our Lord and Saviour
   Was passing to the grave,
 His mild request I spurned,
 His gentle pleading scorned.

"A secret force expelled me
   That instant from my home,
 And since the Doom hath held me
   Unceasingly to roam--
 But neither day nor night
 Must check my onward flight.

"I have no home to hide me,
   No wealth can I display;
 Yet Unknown Powers provide me
   Five farthings every day;
 This always is my store,
   'Tis never less nor more.'"
p/

I may here mention an extremely important work,
<i>Histoire de l'Imagerie Populaire, par Champfleury</i>
(Paris: Dentu, 1869), which contains a number of
pictures taken from the old ballads and folk-books
concerning the Wandering Jew. The early pictures
represent the Jew as a man of noble form, and
generally of a handsome and melancholy countenance.
The only picture in the volume which betrays anti-Jewish
feeling is a modern one from Sweden (where
the Wandering Jew is still believed in), which represents
him in semi-caricature, carrying top-boots at his
back. In most of the pictures the boots worn constitute
a prominent feature. This work of Champfleury
is of value beyond its pictorial representations, on
account of the curiosities which the author has discovered
concerning the adventures of the legend
among rustic populations. The author does not give
us his authority for saying that the Wandering Jew
appeared in some of the mediæval miracle-plays, but
he shows that he was introduced into a French ballet,
<i>Mariage de Pierre de Provence et de la belle Maguelonne,
dancé par son Altesse Royale dans la Ville de
Tours, le 21, en son Hostel</i>, and at Paris in 1638.
There may also be found in this work the Breton
ballad of the Wandering Jew, consisting of 180 verses,
sung at country fairs, to the popular air <i>Güerz, Santez
Anna</i>. This ballad is very ancient, and much more
interesting than that in <i>Percy's Reliques</i>. The
Wanderer calls himself Boudedeo, and tells of the
many countries he has visited. He has always five
sous in his pocket, and is never disturbed by sickness
or hunger. The ballad ends,

/p
"Chrétiens, priez Dieu pour le malheureux Boudedeo!"
p/

Champfleury describes a Wissembourg picture which
shows a beggar raising his hat to the Wanderer and
the latter drops his five sous into the beggar's cap.
This incident tells much of the popular sympathy
felt for persons believed to be the doomed man, and
is remembered by Béranger in his poem:

/p
"Plus d'un pauvre vient implorer
 Le denier que je puis répandre,
 Qui n'a pas le temps de serrer
 La main qu'au passant j'aime à tendre."
p/

Champfleury remarks that, in popular belief, it was
always for inhumanity that Ahasuerus was punished;
and the meaning of this Wissembourg picture is that
as he was punished for lack of charity, he is saved by
his charity. The picture shows a citizen giving the
Wanderer a glass of beer. It is all a lesson of
humanity, but is pictured on a background of such
inhumanity on the part of Christ, that Ahasuerus,
giving away his sous, seems to have taken the place
in human sympathy of the Jew who cursed him.

Dr. Coremans, in his <i>Bulletin de la Commission
royale d'histoire de Belgique</i> (X., No. 1) says that most
of the Belgian villages have their legend of the
passage of the Wandering Jew through them, and
that there is a general notion that he rejuvenates old
women.

The Man in the Moon with his thornbush--if, as
some think, he represents the doom of a Jew, who
picked up fire-wood on the Sabbath, doomed to go on
picking up sticks forever, and be bayed at by Gabriel's
hounds--might typify the shrivelling up in English
folk-lore of the great myths of earthly immortals, including
Ahasuerus.

Mr. William Henderson gives the following example
from the North-country: "An old woman of the
North Riding once asked a friend of mine whether
it was wrong to wash on Good Friday. 'I used to do
so,' she said, 'and thought no harm of it, till once,
when I was hanging out my clothes, a young woman
passed by (a dressmaker she was, and a Methodist);
and she reproved me, and told me this story. While
our Lord Jesus was being led to Calvary, they took
him past a woman who was washing, and the woman
"blirted" the thing she was washing in his face; on
which he said, "Cursed be everyone who hereafter
shall wash on this day!" And never again,' added
the old woman, 'have I washed on Good Friday.'
Now it is said in Cleveland that clothes washed and
hung out to dry on Good Friday will become spotted
with blood; but the Methodist girl's wild legend
reminds me more of one which a relation of mine
elicited from a poor Devonshire shoemaker. She was
remonstrating with him for his indolence and want of
spirit, when he astonished her by replying, 'Don't
'ee be hard on me. We shoemakers are a poor slobbering
race, and so have been ever since the curse that
Jesus Christ laid on us.' 'And what was that?' she
asked. 'Why,' said he, 'when they were carrying him
to the cross, they passed a shoemaker's bench, and the
man looked up and spat at him; and the Lord
turned and said, "A poor slobbering fellow shalt thou
be, and all shoemakers after thee, for what thou hast
done to me."'"[38]

[Footnote 38: <i>Folk-lore of the Northern Counties.</i> Published for the
Folk-lore Society by Satchell, Peyton and Co. 1879. P. 82.]

Such, by the blessing of Protestantism, is the outcome
of the great legends of Veronica and Ahasuerus!
Tithonus, outliving his time, is changed to a grasshopper.
Another instance of the chirpings to which
great myths are reduced may be heard from our
above-mentioned "Seven Whistlers," of which ingenious
use is made by the authoress of "That Lass o'
Lowrie." Mr. James Pearson contributed to "Notes
and Queries" (September 30, 1871) the following:
"One evening, a few years ago, when crossing one of
our Lancashire moors, in company with an intelligent
old man, we were suddenly startled by the whistling
overhead of a covey of plovers. My companion remarked
that when a boy the old people considered
such a circumstance a bad omen, 'as the person
who heard <i>the Wandering Jews</i>'--as he called the
plovers--'was sure to be overtaken with some ill
luck.' On questioning my friend on the name given
to the birds, he said, 'There is a tradition that they
contain the souls of those Jews who assisted at the
crucifixion, and in consequence were doomed to float
in the air forever.' When we arrived at the foot of
the moor, a coach, by which I had hoped to complete
my journey, had already left its station thereby
causing me to finish the distance on foot. The old
man reminded me of the omen."

This superstition is connected with the Gabriel-hounds,
believed in Yorkshire to be human-headed
dogs, or sky-yelpers, as Wordsworth calls them. That
poet tells of an aged peasant--

/p
"With ample sovereignity of eye and ear;
 Rich were his walks with supernatural cheer;
 He the seven birds hath seen that never part,
 Seen the Seven Whistlers on their nightly rounds,
 And counted them! And oftentimes will start,
 For overhead are sweeping Gabriel's hounds,
 Doomed with their impious lord the flying hart
 To chase for ever on aërial grounds."
p/

I may quote here part of the interesting account of
superstitions concerning the Wandering Jew contributed
to "Notes and Queries" (vol. xii. p. 503) by
Mr. V. T. Sternberg. "Sometimes, during the cold
winter nights, the lonely cottager will be awoke by a
plaintive demand for 'Water, good Christian! water,
for the love of God!' And if he looks out, he will see
a venerable old man in antique raiment, with grey
flowing beard and a tall staff, who beseeches his
charity with the most earnest gesture. Woe to the
churl who refuses him water or shelter! My old
nurse, who was a Warwickshire woman, and, as Sir
Walter Scott said of his grandmother, 'a most <i>awfu'
leer</i>,' knew a man who boldly cried out, 'All very fine,
Mr. Ferguson, but you can't lodge here!' And it was
decidedly the worst thing he ever did in his life, for
his best mare fell dead lame, and corn went down I am
afraid to say how much per quarter. If, on the contrary,
you treat him well, and refrain from indelicate
inquiries respecting his age--on which point he is very
touchy--his visit is sure to bring good luck. Perhaps,
years afterwards, when you are on your death-bed, he
may happen to be passing, and if he should, you are
safe; for three knocks with his staff will make you
hale, and he never forgets any kindnesses. Many
stories are current of his wonderful cures, but there is
one to be found in Peck's <i>History of Stamford</i> which
possesses the rare merit of being written by the patient
himself. Upon Whitsunday, in the year of our Lord
1658, 'about six of the clock, just after evensong,' one,
Samuel Wallis, of Stamford, who had been long
wasted with a lingering consumption, was sitting by
the fire, reading in that delectable book called <i>Abraham's
Suit for Sodom</i>. He heard a knock at the
door, and, as his nurse was absent, he crawled to open
it himself. What he saw there Samuel shall say in
his own style: 'I beheld a proper, tall, grave old man.
Thus he said, "Friend, I pray thee, give an old
pilgrim a cup of small beere?" And I said, "Sir, I
pray you, come in and welcome." And he said, "I
am no sir, therefore call me not sir; but come in I
must, for I cannot pass by thy doore." After finishing
the beere, "Friend," he said, "thou art not well?" I
said, "No, truly, sir, I have not been well this many
years." He said, "What is thy disease?" I said, "A
deep consumption, sir; our doctors say, past cure:
for truly, I am a very poor man, and not able to
follow doctor's counsel." "Then," said he, "I will fell
thee what thou shalt do; and, by the help and power
of Almighty God above, thou shalt be well. Tomorrow,
when thou risest up, go into thy garden, and
get there two leaves of red sage and one of bloodworte,
and put them into a cup of thy small beere. Drink
as often as need require, and when the cup is empty,
fill it again, and put in fresh leaves every fourth day,
and thou shalt see, through our Lord's great goodness
and mercy, before twelve dayes shall be past, thy
disease shall be cured and thy body altered."' After
this simple prescription, Wallis pressed him to eat.
But he said, 'No, friend, I will not eat; the Lord
Jesus is sufficient for me. Very seldom doe I drinke
any beere neither, but that which comes from the
rocke. So, friend, the Lord God be with thee.' So
saying, he departed, and was never more heard of;
but the patient got well within the given time, and for
many a long day there was war hot and fierce among
the divines of Stamford, as to whether the stranger
was an angel or a devil. His dress had been minutely
described by honest Sam. His coat was purple, and
buttoned down to the waist; 'his britches of the same
couler, all new to see to;' his stockings were very
white, but whether linen or jersey, deponent knoweth
not; his beard and head were white, and he had a
white stick in his hand. The day was rainy from
morning to night, 'but he had not one spot of dirt
upon his clothes.' Aubrey gives an almost exactly
similar relation, the scene of which he places in the
Staffordshire moorlands. He there appears in a
purple shag gown,' and prescribes balm-leaves."

Brand mentions having seen one of these 'impostors'
going about Newcastle-on-Tyne, followed by a crowd,
and murmuring to himself "Poor Jack all alone!"
Probably Brand did not hear the phrase rightly,
since the cry of the Wanderer was "Poor Joe all
alone!" There was a crossing-sweeper near St. Paul's
Churchyard, who murmured the same, of whom there
is an engraving in the British Museum. A picture of
the Newcastle man was made for the Musgraves of
Eden Hall, which has beneath it "Poor Joe all alone!"
My friend Mr. W. B. Scott, who once resided at Newcastle,
writes that he remembers hearing of him.
"He seemed to have left an impression of a somewhat
respectful kind, but from what cause I never
heard; probably he had a history of a melancholy
kind, and had been left alone by some calamity."

This, so far as I can learn, was the last appearance
in the world of any man pretending to be the Wandering
Jew, if indeed he did so pretend, and the honour
was not thrust upon him by the superstitious crowd.
There had been advantages enough in earlier times
to entice Ahasuerus, or "the famous Joseph," to
make his appearance. He came as a "witness" for
Christ; he was generally a pious Christian; a tradition
tells of his gambling in Naples, but, as the
people there invoke their saints for luck in gambling,
the exception is not considerable. Jurisconsult Louvet
heard him preaching to street crowds in a French
province like a revivalist friar. But in England common
sense gradually chilled the Wandering Jew. When
it was found that he was not above receiving sixpences
to support his imperishable existence the public lost
interest in him.

A question addressed by me a few weeks ago to
the <i>Newcastle Weekly Chronicle</i> elicited the following
answer:

/#
"It is quite true that a man who was known as
'The Wandering Jew' lived in Newcastle during the
latter part of last century. He left a son, who I
believe has lived in Hull the greater part of this
century, and who is now a very old man indeed,
keeping a small public-house named the Cricketers'
Arms. He is very eccentric, is known as 'Topper,
the Newcastle Fossil,' and attracts a deal of attention
on account of his appearance and the condition of his
house. He is a very peculiar-looking man, with
features of a decided Jewish cast. His clothes appear
to be as old as himself. He has never been known to
be clean: and old people in Hull do not remember
the counter or floor of his house to have been washed.
He is supposed to be emulating 'Dirty Dick' of
London in this respect.

This may be regarded as the epitaph upon an
ancient dream which branched into a vast and
various mythology, and, in its time, bore for millions
their hopes of a renovated earth, and their visions of
resurrection from the sleep of death!




XV.

THE NEW AHASUERUS IN GERMANY.


Having, as a figure of popular faith, gathered to him
all related elements of mould and decay, and found fit
extinction in the Newcastle "fossil" just mentioned,
Ahasuerus rises for new wanderings as a poetic
ideal.

The Germans were the first to deal seriously with our
legend, and their literature of the Wandering Jew is
indicated in this chapter. The subject attracted the
unhappy <sc>Daniel Friedrich Schubart</sc> during his
imprisonment. Carlyle, in the notes to his <i>Life of
Schiller</i>, says the idea of making old <i>Joannes a temporibus</i>,
the 'Wandering,' or, as Schubart's countrymen
denominate him, the 'Eternal Jew,' into a novel hero
was a mighty favourite with him. "In this antique
cordwainer, as on a raft at anchor in the stream of
time, he would survey the changes and wonders of
two thousand years: the Roman and the Arab were
to figure there, the Crusader and the Circumnavigator,
the Eremite and the Thebaid, and the Pope of Rome.
Joannes himself, the Man existing out of Time and
Space--Joannes, the unresting and undying--was to
be a deeply tragic personage. Schubart warmed himself
with this idea, and talked about it in his cups, to the
astonishment of simple souls. He even wrote a certain
rhapsody connected with it, which is published in
his poems. But here he rested; and the project of
the Wandering Jew, which Goethe likewise meditated
in his youth, is still unexecuted. Goethe turned to
other objects, and poor Schubart was surprised by
death in the midst of his schemes, on the 10th of
October, 1791." But the project, as we shall see, is not
unexecuted.

Schubart's <i>Rhapsody</i> appeared in his "Poems,
Frankfort, 1787."[39] His Ahasuerus has retired into
the wild solitudes of Mount Carmel. There he is
seen, with frantic laughter, casting away the dry skulls
of his relatives, which break to pieces, crying, "That
is my father! Those are my wives! these my children!
They could die, but I--outcast--cannot die!"
And again, "Jerusalem fell; I crushed the babe, I
rushed into the flames, cursed the Roman!--Rome
fell, whole nations perished, and--I remained!" He
tries to kill himself in different ways, but in vain. He
feels pain acutely, but has to endure every variety of
it, even to the agonies of the moment of death, without
this moment ever arriving. The snake bites
him, the dragon tortures, the burning forest blisters
him. He says to himself, "Under my feet the mine
exploded and threw me high into the air; senseless
I fell down, and found myself roasted amidst
blood, and brains, and bones." He is obliged to carry
on a corpse-like body, infirm, smelling of the grave;
and through thousands of years he must see, like a
yawning monster, an everlasting sameness. The
rhapsody brings the Wanderer to a peaceful end.
Ahasuerus throws himself down from the top of
Carmel into the abyss, "and night covers his bushy
eyelids. An angel carries him into a recess in the
rocks. 'There mayest thou sleep now,' says the
angel; 'sleep, Ahasuerus, sleep soundly! God's
anger does not last for ever.'"

[Footnote 39: The outlines of German poems that follow, are condensed
from a pamphlet entitled:--<i>Die Sage vom 'Ewigen Juden,' ihre
poetische Wandlung und Fortbildung</i>. Von Friedrich Helbig.
Berlin, 1874. For this pamphlet and assistance in its translation
I am indebted to Fräulein Almata Jacobi (Bremen).]

In 1807 appeared the ballad of <i>The Eternal Jew</i>, by
<sc>Aloys Schreiber</sc>. The torture of this Ahasuerus
consists in his not being able to enjoy life and nature,
open to all other men, on account of his restlessness.
He cannot drink the water of the fountain, he cannot
rest in the shade of a tree, he cannot break a flower to
enjoy its smell, for which he longs; he must start, he
must wander. In this he differs from Schubart's
Ahasuerus, who had long been weary of life. Being
continually obliged to renounce everything, he at last
becomes timid, shy; he flies all men and hurries on
heedlessly. Finally he observes a crucifix by the wayside;
about to rush on, an impulse brings him to his
knees, imploring the Crucified for forgiveness. Christ
answers him from the cross, "Whoever has failed
may repent; and none who loves and believes in me
shall need to shun my countenance." The Wanderer
is found dead, kneeling before the cross.

<sc>Wilhelm Müller</sc>, in his <i>Wanderlieder</i> (published
in his works, 1830) has a poem on "The Eternal Jew,"
which pictures the desolation and loneliness that
torture a life satiated to disgust, longing for rest and
death. It is pervaded by melancholy. "Although I
have seen everything I am never allowed to rest!"
All around him has an end: the river in the ocean,
the eagle on the Alps, the cloud in the falling rain,
and also "to the tired wanderer a certain limit has
been fixed. What, does he complain of his day's
misery?--before night death will have taken him
home." The end of the poem is a wish of the poor
Wanderer that those who have finished their earthly
pilgrimage might, ere they go to sleep for ever, ask
of God one hour's rest for him.

<sc>Nikolaus Lenau</sc> has treated the subject in a
similar manner. The scenery of his poem, <i>Ahasuerus,
the Eternal Jew</i>, is a lonely heath. In a distant
meadow shepherds are seen surrounding and weeping
over the corpse of a beloved youth. Whilst they are
thus standing a Wanderer passes that way: his hair is
grey, his countenance pale, cold, deeply wrinkled; his
beard long and white, his fiery eyes in dark sockets.
He walks on to the bier, and calls out, with mingled
mockery and mournfulness, "Suppress your ungrateful
tears; his rest is good; oh yes, his rest is good!
Though fools like you complain, his heart is still;
while mine beats on by night and day, in restless
longing to find its sabbath in the grave!" The
Wanderer utters the philosophy of Schopenhauer,
explaining that the earth is only the lie of Paradise,
that it is always the same old delusion of Time--all
flowering to its destruction: a philosophy which terminates
in a marriage with Madness, personified in
Lenau himself.

Meanwhile, says the poem, the shepherds cover the
coffin. Suddenly the stranger gets sight of the
crucifix on the lid of the coffin. He is frightened, and
tears come to his eyes. Now the Lenau-Schopenhauer
turns out to be Ahasuerus. He tells the story
of his life in the usual form of the myth. He tells the
different kinds of death he had vainly sought. Then
he wanders on, on--on; above his head you hear the
whizzing of the birds; a long shadow walks behind
him; the shepherds tremble and make the sign of the
cross.

Although <sc>Adalbert von Chamisso</sc> was by birth
French, his life and culture were German; his mixed
origin is shown in his subjective poem, the "New
Ahasuerus" (1836), where the Wanderer is simply a
lover whose mistress has married another! This rejected
lover compares himself to Ahasuerus, who cannot
die or rest until the Day of Judgment, while the
faithless lady represents the fallen city of Jerusalem.
Ahasuerus says, "Time stands still before me; the
age of man is as one moment, and the moments ages.
Every hundred years I come once more to Jerusalem,
mourning over its cold ashes, trying to put the ruins
in their old place again, but nobody takes notice of
me; evermore I come to the same thing--a grave!"
Ahasuerus is "the son of sorrow turned into stone."

The poem of <sc>A. W. Schlegel</sc>, "The Eternal Jew,"
follows the old myth, with nothing new. His Ahasuerus,
on account of his unbelief, wanders through the
world as a solace for all those who are miserable,
until the reappearance of Christ releases him.

<sc>Julius Mosen</sc> is the first who treated the subject
in a fuller and more independent way. His "Ahasuerus"
(1838) is an epic. In the notes it is stated that
the myth belongs to the poet's earliest recollections,
the supposed Wandering Jew having passed through
his birthplace, and that a shepherd had spoken to him.
The poem carries this idea out with poetical realism.
Mosen's idea of the myth is human nature imprisoned
by an earthly existence. Ahasuerus symbolises the
spirit of Tradition embodied in an individual being,
who, at first in unconscious obstinacy, but at length
deliberately, opposes himself to the God of Christendom.
Mosen gives his Ahasuerus from the first a
human trait. His deceased wife has left him two
beautiful children, Eve and Reuben. A young Roman
prince, living at Jerusalem, likes these children, and he
wishes to take them with him to Rome. He applies
to Pilate, who orders Ahasuerus to part with the children.
The father in his desperation implores the
assistance of Jesus, the new prophet. He will believe
in him and his new doctrine, if he can save his children.
Jesus will not grant such private wishes, but
goes on to prophesy the fall of Jerusalem. Upon
this Ahasuerus tears his clothes into pieces, and in
pain and wrath accuses Jesus of falsehood and imposture:
"Thou art our God? And yet to save thou
hast no power! If man or God, thou hast deceived
the people!" When the Roman prince comes to
fetch the children, Ahasuerus has slain them. In his
despair he becomes more and more a disbeliever.
What, he asks himself, did Israel commit to become
so wretched? "Through its piety it has been led to
misery. Why, then, does man crowd after this
haughty God? I will cast off his memory; death to
this Nazarene, to God, to everything!" In this excitement
Ahasuerus scornfully forbids Jesus to rest at his
door when he asks that favour. Jesus pronounces his
sentence in these words, "Thou shalt live without rest
thy immortality upon earth!"

The Archangel Michael appears and gives Ahasuerus
a hope that mercy may be obtained at three different
times of trial. The trials follow. Ahasuerus has
married again and has once more two children, Eve
and Reuben. Rome declares war against Judea, Titus
surrounds Jerusalem; Ahasuerus is full of resentment
against God, who declines to help, and in his anger
sets the temple on fire. During the conflagration,
with his children at his side, he enters the flames,
which do not touch him. Eve's lover, Matthias, who
has become a Christian, for that reason rejected by
Ahasuerus, serves in the Roman army and comes
rushing through the flames to save his beloved.
Ahasuerus bids him welcome as a suitor, and pushes
him into the flames. His children shriek with terror,
and Ahasuerus throws them both after him, crying,
"Here, heartless God! now thou canst rejoice!"

The first trial thus passes without redemption for
Ahasuerus, and the second comes. Ahasuerus, having
tried all possible ways of suicide, at last addresses
Death with an appeal for pity. Death replies that he
has orders to pass him by until he shall believe in
God. Ahasuerus refuses. He is once more father
of two beautiful children, Leah and Reuben. He
enjoys the purest happiness, when all at once, in a
thunderstorm, the God of the Jews appears to renew
the old league with him against Christ. Ahasuerus
consents, and is sent to Julian the Apostate as the
great adversary of Christendom. Ahasuerus arrives
there in the very moment when the wounded Julian,
under a night-vision of Christ, begins to doubt his
pagan faith. Ahasuerus gains him back to his former
antagonism, and obtains permission to rebuild the
temple at Jerusalem. But during the building, a
dispute breaks out among the workmen. All order
is gone, the work is interrupted; one looks at another
in amazement, when suddenly a prophet announces
that for the reconstruction of the temple, the God of
Judea and the God of the Christians were contending;
and that the latter could only be made to yield if the
blood of two innocent children should soak the
ground. Ahasuerus offers his own children. Before
the sacrifice is finished, Christ invisibly takes the
children to Himself. Then the earth is rent asunder;
flames dart out and consume the new building.

The second trial having passed without saving
Ahasuerus, twice a murderer of his own children, the
third trial advances. In this Death passes, with souls
that have found repose, before Ahasuerus. Ahasuerus
is in mortal agony; his soul has nearly departed, but
one point still remains, which no effort of his will can
destroy. This point begins to assume a shape, a form
once more. It is the same point of life which goes
through all organic nature, and nowhere admits of
destruction or state of rest. So our Wanderer, too,
is once more filled with the wish to live. Again the
God of Judea animates him to struggle against the
doctrine of Christ. Again he follows his advice. He
is now sent to Arabia, where Mohammed leads on the
nations against the Cross. Ahasuerus allies himself
with Mohammed to conquer Jerusalem he calls his
people together, but they will not hear him, they have
only stones to throw at him who suffered so much for
their sake. Then, with tears in his eyes, Ahasuerus
leaves them for ever, and bestows henceforth his love
upon Humanity.

Mosen's Ahasuerus thus becomes a hero of
Humanity, and his aims rise high above his first
purpose. He is at the head of Mohammed's warriors,
driving away the defenders of the Holy Sepulchre,
menacing death to all who approach it. All fly away;
two children only remain--his own. Ahasuerus embraces
them, and rejoices to have found them at last.
Then Mohammed reminds him that he has sworn
death to whomsoever should approach the sepulchre.
Ahasuerus now cries out in his grief. For the third
time he falls under the curse of his disbelief. He
calls for some one to slay him, and the third trial so
releases him of his vow. Arrows dart through the air:
the children fall; he, too, sinks down, to awake once
more for fulfilment of his real mission. "One thing
has been ended; another begins, that neither time nor
dark eternity can end. Loosed from Him and His
mercy, henceforth I begin a long struggle until I have
saved mankind from Him." Ahasuerus declares an
everlasting war against Christ, "in the name of all
forces and powers, all sighs, all sorrows, shed tears
and blood, broken spirits and crushed hearts." Christ
accepts the combat: "Thou facest Me, Thought
against Thought. Wrestle on and on, until at last,
the circle ended, the Day of Judgment shall
decide!"

There the poem ends, or rather, as Helbig remarks,
"does <i>not</i> end;" the end is put off to the day of the
last Judgment. The struggle now only begins, never
to end, between Ahasuerus and Christ, between
Humanity and Christendom, between Earth and
Heaven.

<sc>Ludwig Köhler</sc>, too, makes the Wanderer a type
of human tendency. His <i>New Ahasuerus</i> (1845) is a
prophet of freedom. The sufferer he has derided says
to him: "March on then for eternities, until veracity
has found its residence on earth, filling it with purest
brightness! until a golden Dawn as of springtide breaks,
and Liberty awakes the light now hidden in night!"
Often the Wanderer thinks this morning has come, and
exults in his hope of rest; but his joy, his hopes are
vain. Napoleon crushes the French Revolution, "the
Burschenschaft" leads to the errors of Sand; the
rebellious Greeks are betrayed, and so on. Everywhere
is oppression of conscience and thought.
Ahasuerus despairs, and complains that he cannot
die, when suddenly Jesus addresses him with a
rebuke: he tells Ahasuerus that he is unworthy of the
longed-for liberty, so long as he has not mastered self
and sacrificed his egotism. "Thy grave, not humanity,
was thine aim, so thou hast striven in vain. Liberty
shall be aim, not instrument to thee. Whilst thou
wert complaining of Destiny, it went its way, and
Liberty began its heavenly progression. 'Tis no dream
and delusion; ere thou thinkest, it sunders hell and
displays its light. The world gets free. Already in
the vale a stir is heard. Its reign is near!" With this
vision of hope for the future the poet leaves us.

<sc>Franz Horn</sc> (1818) published in Fouqué's
<i>Frauentaschenbuch</i> his novel "<i>The Eternal Jew</i>." His
Ahasuerus is a rich Jew in Jerusalem, who only
believes in Christ's external mission. He thinks
that Jesus, though for the time full of humility,
will rule with a commanding sceptre when clad in
purple, and by his healing power will extirpate
disease and death from the earth. In this he is disappointed:
Jesus is laughed at, despised, ill-treated,
and endures all unresistingly. Mistaken in his dearest
hopes, Ahasuerus conceives a deep hate against
Jesus. So, when the latter, fallen under the burthen
of his cross, asks for a moment's rest at his door,
Ahasuerus drives him on without compassion. Then
Christ rises, and says: "Well, receive then what thou
wishest; live, live on, as never man before; die not
till thou hast become worthy to die!"

And so it came: all around him died; everything
became strange to him; only the sky above him
remained the same. He comes to understand that
Christ by his death has sealed death, and that he
(Ahasuerus) by his life has to represent the insufficiency
and misery of mere life. He moves on with
aimless strides, his form as of iron, his visage weather-beaten
like lichened stone, a nameless grief upon his
features. The scene of the novel is laid at the end
of the Thirty Years' War. Ahasuerus has saved a
young count in the tumult of battle, and afterwards,
by telling him the story of his life, converts him from
the blasphemy and despair into which he had fallen
by the sudden death of his family--a misfortune
attributed to the appearance of Ahasuerus.

From this novel, <sc>August Klingemann</sc> (1827)
took the subject of his tragedy, <i>Ahasuerus</i>. The
Wanderer was a favourite character with the distinguished
actor Ludwig Devrient. With Klingemann
the myth signifies purification by suffering
in order to obtain an imperishable liberty. Christ
appears as the mediator between natural and supernatural
things, and points the wandering man to his
coming empire. The hero of Klingemann's drama is
the murderer of Gustavus Adolphus, the Count of
Werth, a fanatical Catholic, who, in disguise of a
Protestant, has assassinated the champion of Protestantism.
The deed weighs heavily on his soul, drives
him to melancholy and despair, and he finally drowns
his conscience in Atheism. The son of Gustavus
Adolphus enters his family as a visitor; and in his
presence, and that of his family, the guilty Count
speaks of the deed with abhorrence. Only one person
knows of his guilt--the mysterious man who saved
him out of the battle. To get rid of him the assassin
challenges him; but his lance breaks on the breast of the
stranger--for it is Ahasuerus, he who has blasphemed
his Lord, like the now atheistical Count of Werth.
The curse upon him is that which strikes the Denier
of God. Ahasuerus, after the fruitless combat, reveals
to the count his story, and his longing to die, imploring
him no longer to blaspheme God. The Count
after this discovery acknowledges the existence of
God, and confesses his murder of Gustavus Adolphus.
He then kills himself, and so finds rest; but Ahasuerus
wanders on--on!

<sc>Theodor Oelkers</sc> has treated the subject in a
novel, <i>Princess Mary of Oldenhoff, or the Wandering
Jew</i>, (Leipzig, 1848). Oelkers adds a curse upon
Ahasuerus: in order to reconcile Christ he must
sacrifice what is dearest to him, but his sacrifices are
always ineffectual. He takes from time to time a
wife, he has children; he survives each wife, slays his
children; he is driven to do this by necessity, while
conscious that the offerings will be in vain. He has
the fearful gift of reading the future: foresees all that
shall happen to himself and his beloved ones. In
bitterness of heart he says: "Let men see in me how
vain is their hope for divine love and mercy!" But
at length he finds reason to hope for release at a very
distant period. "I am only," he says, "condemned in
Time: Eternity belongs to me, as it belongs to all when
Time shall end. Then shall I be free to move about
in endless regions, breathing the air of heaven; then
the partial tyranny of Grace shall be dethroned;
Justice will occupy the throne, sharing it with her
sister, Love."

Oelkers thinks that before this time comes there
will also appear a Wandering Moslem and a Wandering
Christian.

<sc>Levin Schücking</sc>, too, brings our hero before us
in an episode, full of imagination, called "The
Three Suitors" which belongs to his novel <i>The
Peasant Prince</i>, 1851. In the hotel of "The Three
Moors," at Augsburg, during the twelve nights after
Christmas in the year 1700, three strangers met
together. One was a weary half-decayed Jew, with a
long dirty gown, who next morning changes into a
handsome young Armenian Prince, Isaac Laquedam.
The second was the Dutch admiral Van der Decken,
who arrives in a carriage with four horses. The third
was his Excellency the Master of Chase <i>en chef</i>, Herr
von Rodenstein, with a large suite. These individuals
have a rendezvous in this inn every hundred years, and
pass one year together in revelling, after which they
disappear. They lose their human form and wander
as spectres, one over the earth, one over the sea, the
third in the air, as the Eternal Jew, the Flying Dutchman,
the Wild Huntsman; all in bond and service of
Satan, except for this one year, wherein he has no
power over them. Whenever one century is passed,
Ahasuerus-Laquedam is seized by a burning fever,
after which his body resumes the appearance it had
when he raised his hand against Jesus.

All three do a great deal of mischief during that
year in quiet Augsburg, especially in the hearts of the
young women. Among these is one distinguished by
great beauty, but also by her haughtiness and disdain
towards the male sex. All three try to win her proud
and frosty heart, which unfortunately has been
chained to an ugly, paralytic husband. She once
says to them that she is not proud of her beauty,
but that she would take a pride in standing a danger
or conquering a difficulty of which, centuries later,
the world would say, <i>a man would have been unable
to subdue it</i>.

The handsome Armenian prince takes her at her
word and invites her to follow him one whole year:
she promises it, and gives him as pledge of her word
a ring. The two others obtain similar promises. At
the end of the year she accompanies the Armenian.
Suddenly she sees his youth disappear, a musty smell
comes from him, and a third shadow walks at their
side. "Who are you," she cries aghast. "I am
Ahasuerus!" She tries to fly, but Ahasuerus holds
her with an iron hand. In her despair she sells her
soul to the third shadow (the Devil) who promises her
deliverance. But first, she has to keep her word to the
Rodensteiner. With him, the Wild Huntsman, she
rides through the air, and from aloft beholds the
depravity of human life. From what she has seen,
and from the wild ride, her soul and body are tormented,
she is unable to go any farther, and again
implores deliverance of the Devil. Already the Flying
Dutchman has come to claim fulfilment of her
promise to him. The Devil agrees to save her if she
will pledge him, besides her own, the soul of her
child.

"No, never my child, never!" the tortured woman
cries; she prefers another year's ride, over the sea.
"Take her, she longs still for a third trial," says the
laughing Devil to the Dutchman; but he replies:
"The trial was great enough, she is released. Her
force was superior to that of a man. <i>A man would
not have spared the soul of his child more than he did his
own.</i>" She wakes to find her child sleeping sweetly
in its cradle; she finds also the three rings; but from
the dream of a night her beautiful hair was grey.

<sc>Joseph von Zedlitz</sc>, an Austrian poet, in his <i>Wanderings
of Ahasuerus</i> (1844), transfers the end of the
Jew's life to the Golden Age, when the reign of eternal
Peace has begun. Ahasuerus has long been buried on
Golgotha, when an angel awakes him, and bids him
wander until Noah's white dove, the messenger of
peace, comes back, bringing peace on earth and songs
of joy, dispersing all wrath and hatred, uniting the
nations under the sceptre of Humanity. Ahasuerus,
lying in his grave, half-dreaming, sees history pass
before his eyes; he awaits the time that shall come.
Whenever he thinks this moment has arrived, he rises
from his grave, and wanders about to see the world.
It seems to him that the Golden Age is near, when
the Roman Empire sinks and the star of Christendom
rises; when the cherub's song of peace strikes his ear,
he begins his pilgrimage. He expected to find peace,
but he finds ruins, ashes, death. He meets Attila's
wild bands on his way. When Ahasuerus, 1300
years later, rises once more, he finds another Attila,
who wants to bend a whole world under his sceptre.
Terror-stricken, Ahasuerus cries: "Who can say
Attila will not return a third time?" and returning to
his grave, he asks: "Jehovah, how long must I still
sleep?"

<sc>Hans Christian Andersen's</sc> <i>Ahasuerus</i> is
the angel of Doubt, who comes upon earth to live
with men, whom he resembles, for like them he denies
and doubts. He is born on earth at the same moment
with Jesus, and now, as a human being, bears the
name Ahasuerus. As a man he grows wiser and
better, like his fellow-men, whose increasing perfection
will, in many thousands of years, lead them to heaven.
Then Ahasuerus too will return.

After this Prologue Ahasuerus is seen as a Jewish
shoemaker; he is at the same time a favourite narrator
of the stories of the Bible. Merry children, as well as
serious Pharisees, come to his workshop, and listen to
his words. He becomes conceited, and complains
that he is only a shoemaker, and not allowed to sit
among the Scribes. Among his auditors is young
Veronica, who is enchanted with the new prophet
from Nazareth, who had just made his appearance.
Ahasuerus counts Jesus amongst the false prophets;
he also regards him as the cause of the death of his
mother and sister, who had been slain by the agents
of Herod. But when he hears Jesus preach in the
desert, he changes his mind, and shares the admiration
of Veronica. Now, he thinks, the days of splendour
will come, according to the prophets, and the reign of
David in all its magnificence. Judas, the friend of
Ahasuerus, and the enthusiastic disciple of Jesus, is
the first to doubt him. He thinks Jesus does not
show enough energy in his proceedings, calls him a
loiterer; at length decides to test whether he is really
the Messias. If so, legions of angels will certainly
assist him at his call; if not, he may perish. Judas
betrays Jesus, in order to give him an opportunity to
show his power--an idea suggested by Goethe. The
hope of Judas is not realised. Jesus consents to be
made a prisoner. "Man he was, and not Messiah!" says
Ahasuerus, turning apostate; "how could I imagine
that the son of a carpenter was a prophet? He feels
the cold, suffers hunger, thirst, needs sleep."

After the usual scene on the way to Golgotha, a
voice from above says to the disbelieving Ahasuerus:
"Ahasuerus, Ahasuerus! thou art the type of mankind;
thou disputest and deniest God himself. Ye
are all alike; so thou mayest wander until we shall
meet once again!"

It is not real Atheism, but a rigid Judaism that
will not surrender to what the author deems the
unfolding purposes of God, which appears in this
Ahasuerus.

The first person whom Ahasuerus meets in his
wanderings is Barabbas, who lives as an hermit in
Lebanon, repenting his sins. He has already been
mentioned in the poem as a profligate who only
knows the god of his senses; but the crucifixion and
the resurrection of Christ, which he has witnessed,
have converted him. He receives his friend with the
words, "Blessed be Jesus Christ." Ahasuerus answers
with a curse. Full of wrath, not believing in the
resurrection, he takes his leave of Barabbas. He trusts
in the strength of Israel, but soon after he is told of
Jerusalem's fall. He travels to Rome, where Domitian
is persecuting the Christians. He rejoices when he
sees the burning pyres and the Christian martyrs.
He stands at the side of executioners who torture
some Christians. Among these is Veronica. He
cannot convert her, and tries therefore to slay her.
He does not succeed in so saving her from torture,
but is suspected and (apparently) killed by the executioners.
Ahasuerus awakes to find beside him the
dead Veronica, and many other bodies of martyred
Christians. He starts forth in terror to flee the kingdom
of the Crucified, which he sees consisting only
of "graves laden with the smell of Pestilence."

Having passed through distant parts of the world,
Ahasuerus, at the end of three centuries, returns to
Rome. He finds that the doctrine of Christ has
conquered heathendom. The Emperor and his people
are kneeling with Christ's name on their lips. "The
spirit of Jehovah has left the earth; his people is lost
in this world-chaos. The old is all dead; the new is
vain and empty! Jehovah! my breast is Thy temple,
the last in this ruined world!"

Ahasuerus passes the Alps. The Huns sweep by.
He inspires Attila to attack Rome and crush Christendom.
But he--he wanders on, farther on, to the
region of the Northern Light. On his return he finds
thick in the forests the symbols of Christ; he finds
Christ now worshipped in Gaul, and in Rome the first
Pope. Compelled now to believe in the power of the
Christian faith, he yet persists in his belief that a still
greater God will come, the true Messiah promised to
Israel. The poet then describes the small communities
of Jews, with their quiet and secret worship, still
awaiting their Messiah. Some think he has come in
the person of Mohammed, and to him Ahasuerus now
goes. He advances with him to Jerusalem; there he
is about to set the temple on fire, when Veronica
appears and prevents him. He journeys on. In
Rome Charlemagne has been made emperor; the
Jews have become slaves of the Christians. The
hate of this inflexible believer in Jehovah increases.
By a vast leap the poet brings Ahasuerus to Canossa,
where, full of astonishment, he sees the emperor, barefooted
and in tears, standing before the Vicar of
Christ. Before such evidence of the Majesty of Christendom,
Ahasuerus, too, stands with bended head.
He cannot escape this new kingdom, for he is in the
closed yard of the world which it fills. "The emperor
stood for nights; my nights are millenniums!"

And now for the first time the idea rises in him
that he is not only the Opposing Jew, but that he
represents everything earthly in conflict with the
divine.

The time of the Crusades comes. From all parts of
the world the nations rush to Jerusalem, where once
the altar of Jehovah stood. They are impelled by
many selfish motives: no single thought or aim unites
the warriors, and so they struggle in vain. Ahasuerus
now learns to doubt the progress of mankind. In
vain a master-builder beside his work instructs him
that in the structure of the world God is the builder.
"He does not die; each century is a stone block
added to the rest: so mankind gradually ascends."
"But," Ahasuerus says, "often the work stands still."
"It does," answers the stonemason, "but only to gather
new strength." To this Ahasuerus answers that all the
blood that has been shed in the Crusades was of no
use to Europe; but the guildmaster replies that they
formed a vast step in human progress, because they
brought the different nations closer together, and
brought "liberty" into the world. Many knights sold
their estates, which passed into the hands of the commons;
the supremacy of nobles was destroyed, new
life sprang up in sciences and art. Then suddenly
the cry of battle rings through the air, robber knights
menace the peaceful citizens; the tocsin sounds; the
workmen rush to the battlefield; the building stops.
Full of mockery and derision at this new retrogradation
in place of the vaunted human evolution, Ahasuerus
walks on.

The errors of the age, the doings in the convents,
the excesses of the Hussites, the mad demeanour of
King Wenceslas, only increase Ahasuerus' disbelief in
the progress of mankind. An angel leads him to
Mayence, where Gutenberg's printing-press is seen.
Ahasuerus does not believe in the importance of this
invention. He also thinks Columbus a fool, but,
nevertheless, follows him to the deep whirlpools of the
sea, which he hopes will swallow him. But Columbus
is spared by the waves, he reaches land--the New
World is discovered. There the god of the primeval
forest complains like Ahasuerus, because he has been
roused from his rest and deep silence and is dragged
into the history of men. The all-pervading Spirit of
the Universe addresses him, "Oh, might the discovery
of this new hemisphere come also to thee, that thou
mightst see the divine wisdom, take comfort, and
know that in the future of Humanity there shall be
One people, One mind, Unity and Reason!"

Amid the New World, and with this vision over it,
Ahasuerus gains Belief. He now sees that "it was
the ruin of Israel, once as rich a land as America, to
reject the New, which comes from God." In human
evolution the Old always denies the New: "God is
born, crucified, and--lives." The wave of each century
brings the accumulated treasures of the Past
nearer to the shores of Perfection.

Then Ahasuerus stretches out his hands towards
the endless Ocean, and in the chaos of his mind he
begins to understand what <i>once</i> he was and what has
become of him. In his own life he sees the progress
of mankind, and so the wings grow that bring him
back to Heaven. But the time has not yet come,
only a day of Eternity has elapsed; and Andersen's
Muse tells us in the last words of her song that "the
myth of Ahasuerus is only an echo of the endless tide
of Time; a better Scald will come and tell the meaning
of that other pilgrimage."

<sc>Heller</sc> imitates Andersen in his poem, <i>The
Wanderings of Ahasuerus</i>. In his introduction he
says that Ahasuerus shall lead us through all nations
to the modern world: from God becoming human to
Humanity becoming God. In the first edition (1865)
the poet did not bring his theme to its end. But in a
later edition (1868) he continued his work, and leads
his hero on to the days of Goethe. The conception
and execution of his poem are exactly like those of
Andersen, but Heller presents more historical details,
and his ideas and suggestions are full of interest.
His Ahasuerus is an adversary of Jesus, as one who
does not comprehend his high mission and his own
doctrine. A wealthy shoemaker, his workshop full of
workmen, he is ugly and deformed; his wife, however,
is beautiful. He is an old schoolfellow of the
new prophet, who in former days has often been protected
by him when people asked him tauntingly his
father's name. Ahasuerus's own son bears the name of
Jesus. But now Ahasuerus calls Jesus an adventurer,
who had always been a favourite of women, on account
of his fine looks. He says Jesus has learned the black
art in Egypt, which enables him to win the multitude
with miracles; that he misleads poor fishermen to
leave their work and homes; that he poisons the pure
fountain of the Bible, deriving from it that he is the Son
of Man. He, Ahasuerus, will unmask this dangerous
impostor. So, when he is told by some children that
a fine-looking man much like Jesus has sat down to
take some rest at his door, he scornfully bids him
move on, and not bring a curse upon his house by
touching his threshold. Peter intervenes, but Ahasuerus
laughs at him. Then Jesus rising, he answers, "Unhappy
man! the feelings that so violently move thy
heart come from a misled but believing mind. Sincere
as is thy anger, even now thy heart is kind. If thou
couldst only understand me, no one would shed his
blood for me like thou. The time will come when
thou shalt know me. Until the day when all the
world shall have accepted Christianity thou shalt
wander through the earth with thy people, spared by
Death. Nations shall come and go, but ye shall
remain until the day of the last trumpet."

Ahasuerus re-enters his house speechless. On the
day of the Passover, Saul comes to him, and is told
what happened. He declares Jesus one of those
fanatics who rise everywhere and disappear like
meteors; the streets of Rome are crowded with them.
"Men," says Saul, "are bending under the burthen of
their sins and long for forgiveness, which they do not
find in their Ancient Law. Love, the only thing that
brings release, must be delivered from the chains of
the old institutions." Unconsciously, Saul is already
of the new belief, and is soon after formally converted.
Peter and James try to convert Ahasuerus also, but
they succeed only in engaging him to hear Saul, now
Paul, who preaches in Athens of Christ's resurrection.
Ahasuerus finds out that this doctrine is not in the
Scriptures: Paul must be deceived. He returns to
Jerusalem, in his old disbelief. Jerusalem is conquered,
destroyed; Ahasuerus joins in the combat; at
length all whom he has loved are buried, he leaves the
ancient city in ruins: his wanderings begin.

We find him again, with other fugitive Jews, in a
cavern, gathered about an old Rabbi. They mourn
for Jerusalem, but their master reminds them of the
Law; he exhorts them to adhere firmly to that--it is
stronger than that of Christ's apostles, which is sealed
only by a man, not by God. As Jewish apostles they
go forth into the world. The war begins between
Paganism, Christianity, and Judaism. Ahasuerus tries
to win over the pagans, to bring back those that turn
apostate. The wild movements and anomalies of the
world gradually lead Ahasuerus to the hope of a
kingdom not of this world. He is now seen longing
for Jesus; he flies the noisy world and arrives at the
Lake of Tiberias. There Christ appears to him, and
Ahasuerus implores forgiveness. He has already lost
something of his rigid Jewish faith. When Constantine
has become a Christian, and when Rome falls,
he believes that his new idea will be realised: but no,
straightway begin the disputes of Christian sects.
Ahasuerus turns his back on the contending Gnostics,
Simonians, Arians, and the rest, and comes to the
desert, where he finds Anthony, the hermit. Anthony
has delivered himself from the world and its controversies
to find peace amid nature. They exchange
their experiences and thoughts. Ahasuerus acknowledges
that Christ's doctrine has spread a kingdom of
love over the earth, but that his great work has been
degraded to a mere fable. "I did not find the kingdom
of God, but of men. Here I will rest until some
Angel wakes me from my dream to begin once more
my earthly pilgrimage." Anthony has the same faith;
he will struggle on patiently and imitate the life that
was so full of suffering and love. Henceforth the two
live together in a long brotherhood.

This was the end of Heller's first edition. In the
second he enlarged and transformed the entire poem.
He separates the whole in three different wanderings.
He calls the first, which we have already described,
<i>Ahasuerus's Error of Faith</i>; the second, <i>Picture of
the Universe</i>; the third, <i>Humanity</i>. During his
first pilgrimage, Ahasuerus moves still in the restricted
horizon of a Pharisee, but he loses much of that in his
intellectual intercourse with Anthony. In his second
pilgrimage, although the whole scene of history lies
open before him, he persists still in his hope of a coming
Messias. At last he doubts that his hope will
ever be realised; he frees himself from his rigid belief.
The discovery of the New World, the invention of
typography, and the Reformation, he now regards as
contributing to a free evolution of mankind, leading to
the only true religion: Humanity. Ahasuerus, like
Faust, sees in this the high destiny of mankind.
History unfolds itself before Man; he moves after it,
observing, investigating, looking forward to the fulfilment
of his desire. The movement of mankind over
the Old World goes on; new gods replace the old;
contrasts of all kinds meet together--nowhere is room
for God's empire of peace. Mohammed, too, is not
the right prophet. Under Charlemagne and Leo the
empire of God's majesty on earth is founded, but this
is not the real empire of God for which Ahasuerus
looks. Besides, it does not prove to be everlasting.
Priesthood, to which all nations blindly submit, degenerates;
whilst in Germany, under the Saxon
emperors strong conventional worldly power arises.
Then a new Messias seems to appear in Hildebrand,
this monk so possessed of worldly wisdom; but his
empire is only maintained by the strong reins of
obedience, not by love. The Crusades do not satisfy
Ahasuerus. New persons come before us, one forming
a contrast to the other. Jehuda Levita, who
praises the sublime inheritance of Adam against
the "original sin" of Christendom; then the pious
buffoon, Francis d'Assisi, contrasting with Tannhäuser,
whom Ahasuerus meets in Rome, and whose longing
for the fresh and natural world of his heathen land,
amid the helpless ossification of the Christian priesthood,
he can well understand; Dante, who tries at
least to harmonise the contrasts in poetry; Rienzi, a
political fool, who makes a step backwards into the old
Roman time; Huss, who, a second saviour, a martyr
of the old pure Christian doctrine, expires on the
pyre.

Then Ahasuerus begins to doubt of the duration of
God's empire. When he sees how Christ is always
vanquished, and has now been crucified so often,
a deep melancholy overcomes him; he longs for
death, he is disgusted with seeing the world any
longer. Then Faust appears to him, his congenial
brother; Faust, the realist, who enjoys the life and
liberty given to him, who, though a true friend of
Christendom, does not join the theological disputes,
but with a happy mind prefers the fresh hearts of the
people to the musty churches with their endless
supplications. With Faust's appearance a change
of mind comes over Ahasuerus. Both have still a
third mythical brother, the Spaniard, Don Juan.
Ahasuerus, the first-born, is continually occupied with
the highest problems; he takes no notice of life, and
awaits the day when his faith will be one with that
of Jesus. In sharp contrast with this, the Spaniard
enjoys life and its pleasures, with all his natural
enthusiasm. Between these two, as a mediator, stands
Faust, susceptible of high and noble things as of the
pleasures of the world. He opens Ahasuerus' heart
to the love of humanity; he teaches his dim eyes to
look around him in the world; he shows him all the
productions of industry and art. In his house he
shows him the wonders and first performances of
typography; he leads him to magnificent Florence,
residence of the Medicis; and, escaping the Spanish
Inquisition, they voyage with Columbus to America.
Ahasuerus, who until now thought the earth to be
miserable and small, wishes to remain on it.

In the third part of the poem, Ahasuerus leaves
the New World and returns to the Old, to follow there
the evolution of human thought. He goes to Rome,
and rejoices to see the flourishing state of sciences and
arts; he finds there the great master, Raphael, who
exalts Christianity into Humanity. There also he
meets Luther, who, beholding the corruptions of the
Church, conceives the idea of the Reformation.

<sc>Robert Hamerling</sc> is the last German poet
who has paid his respects to our myth. The hero of
his poem, <i>Ahasuerus in Rome</i> (1867), however, is
Nero, and not Ahasuerus. The latter is only, as by
Klingemann and Horn, a kind of Nemesis in the
piece, a supernatural power intervening in human
actions. He presents a sharp contrast with Nero,
who resembles Faust in his immense love of life,
whilst Ahasuerus has come to Rome longing for
death. He intends to accomplish Nero's fate, for in
spite of their different natures, their mission is the
same; both are fulfilling and advancing the evolution
of mankind. Especially in a place where the decayed
past struggles with new forms of life, history needs
such Titans of destruction as Nero, in order to hasten
the crisis of events and advance human progress.
Ahasuerus therefore makes Nero his unconscious
instrument; he pushes him on and on in his
monstrous attempts. The supposed god, who can
only operate by destruction, Ahasuerus treats as the
indestructible, and by this very faith prepares the way
of Nero's humiliation. Ahasuerus animates Nero to
burn Rome, and swings the first torch; but he comes
himself unharmed out of the flames, spared by the
fire, to show Nero that there is still something on
earth which to destroy is beyond his power; something
like a phœnix rising out of ashes--the immortal
humanity. For a moment Nero thinks himself equal
to this new adversary. "I, too," he cries, "am indestructible:
life in me is firmly anchored: nothing can
ever change me! I am I! I cope with you: our
combat will show if my intellectual indestructibility
balances not thy bodily indestructibility!"

Ahasuerus accepts the combat with the certainty
that the hour of death has come for Nero. It arrives
in the curse of satiety and disgust which overcomes
Nero. He has enjoyed the pleasures of earth, and
Olympus; they have no more for him; only one
thing further remains for him--Hades. By force of
magic he summons the dead; his own victims start
up before him, and, smitten with horror, he falls.
Now, forsaken by his favourites and subjects, Nero
escapes at the hand of the only one remaining--a
devoted German--under the secret guidance of
Ahasuerus, into the catacombs. He there finds a
congregation of Christians, his mortal enemies. He
offers his head to their revenge, and is told that they
do not know such a sensation, that their hearts obey
the law of love, a law which did not exist for him,
because he did not feel anything above him, whither
he could look with a longing eye. For the first time
Nero finds a God who, instead of being worshipped
and feared is beloved. He also understands that not
pleasure but pain saves the world, and cries: "I see
that the ever-creating womb of the human Mind is
not exhausted! The outworn world falls to dust: the
human heart ever brings it forth anew." Thus Nero
pronounces the inner secret of the Ahasuerus-myth
(according to this poem). And although unable to
submit to the new doctrine, he consecrates himself
to the god of the infernal world, exchanging his
longing for life with the ardent longing for death,
according to Ahasuerus' prophecy. Ahasuerus himself
appears in the hour of his adversary's death among
the Christians, and the poet, in an original conception,
makes him assume towards the end of his poem a
gigantic shape.

According to this, Ahasuerus, who once despised
Jesus, was already on earth since time immemorial.
For he is the first-born of the unborn, the first of the
created beings; he is the first child of man, the first
rebel, Cain, the murderer of his brother. Ahasuerus
first brought Death into the world, who now at the
same time rewards and punishes him by sparing
him.

It is greatly to be regretted that the great brain
which carried the legend of <i>Faust</i> to such noble fruit
did not fulfil its design of giving poetic expression to
that of the Wandering Jew. In his <i>Dichtung und
Wahrheit</i>, <sc>Goethe</sc> has sketched the design of this
unwritten poem. A clever shoemaker with whom he
once lodged in Dresden was to be a model for
Ahasuerus. The shoemaker of Jerusalem was to be a
character; in his open workshop he talks with passers-by,
and, after the Socratic fashion, touches up everyone
in his own way. Even Pharisees and Sadducees
like to talk with him, and Jesus with his disciples often
stop there. The shoemaker is a firm secularist, but
he feels a special affection for Jesus, whom he tries to
persuade to give up his visions, and leave off drawing
people away from their work into the wilderness.
Jesus, on the other hand, tries to persuade his friend
to his way of thinking. When Jesus has become a
public character, Ahasuerus warns him that tumult
will follow, and that he (Jesus) will have to place
himself at the head of a party. Finally, when things
have gone their course, Judas rushes into the shoemaker's
shop, in despair, declaring that in endeavouring
to hasten his master's triumph he had only
ruined him. Ahasuerus is in great excitement about
his friend, and when he sees him passing his door
reminds him of his warnings. Jesus does not answer,
but just then the loving Veronica covers his face with
a napkin, on which, as she raises it, Ahasuerus sees
depicted the features of Christ, not as a sufferer, but
transfigured and radiant. As he turns he hears the
words: 'Over the earth shalt thou wander till thou
shalt once more see me in this form!' When the
shoemaker comes to himself he finds that everyone
has gone to the execution. Through the empty
streets he moves, and begins his wanderings.

The way in which Goethe would have dealt with
the theme is indicated by the fact he elsewhere
mentions, that he had meant to bring Ahasuerus to a
meeting with Spinoza. It will be seen, however, in
this chapter, that a number of the best pens which
have dealt with this subject have been spiritually
moved by Goethe.




XVI.

THE NEW AHASUERUS IN FRANCE.


In the year 1833 Edgar Quinet published his "Mystery"
entitled <i>Ahasuerus</i>. It seems an amazing fact
that a work of this importance should never have been
translated into English. It was well appreciated in
France, and was the subject of the excellent review
(<i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, Dec., 1833) which has already
been referred to in this work. It is an epic in prose.
Amid the stately Miltonic forms of Biblical and other
mythology, and through a mist of mysticism, may be
seen Edgar Quinet himself bent under the doom of
turning the faith of his childhood, the illusions of
all he loved, into mere conventionalised foliations of
a frame around the reality of a creature moving
about amid worlds for ever dead.

His early faith having suffered what he fondly
hoped might prove to be transient eclipse, he started
upon those restless journeyings through Europe and
the East, which were still less restless than his spiritual
wanderings; but at no point could he see any faintest
arc of a sun returning from its eclipse. The old light
had for ever gone down. As he wandered there arose
before him this other self, this doomed Ahasuerus.
Through ten years he was writing it; it was written,
he has told us, on foot, on horseback, in the gondola,
at sea; in cathedrals of Germany, basilicas of Rome,
in the convent of Bron, in the villas of Naples, and
the almshouses of Morea. "Its aim is to reproduce some
scenes of the universal tragedy played between God,
Man, and the World." In the end Quinet married a
German lady, Rachel by name, who appears in his
dramatic epic also as the saviour of Ahasuerus.

The work is divided into four "Days," with three
interludes, a prologue, and an epilogue. The first day
is "The Creation;" the second, "The Passion," discussed
by the devils as a rather poor comedy.
Ahasuerus appears in this second "Day." He is
seated on his bench in an open door as Jesus passes
with his cross, followed by a crowd which praises
Barabbas and Pilate. Ahasuerus believes Jesus a
magician, and when he says, "Is it thou, Ahasuerus?"
the latter says, "I know thee not." "I thirst; give
me a little water from thy spring." "My well is
empty." "Reach thy cup--thou wilt find it full."
"It is broken." "Help me to bear my cross along
this hard path?" "I am not thy cross-porter; call a
griffin from the desert." "Let me sit on thy bench at
thy house door?" "My bench is full; there is no
room for another." "On thy threshold?" "It is
empty, but the door is shut and bolted." "Touch it,
and you can enter to get a stool." "Go thy way!" "If
thou wilt, thy bench may become a golden seat in the
house of my Father." "Go, blaspheme where thou
wilt! Thou hast already withered with thy footsteps
my vine and fig-tree; do not set foot on my stairway,
it will crumble under thy speech. Thou wouldst bewitch
me." "I wish to save thee." "Diviner, leave
my shadow! Thy road is before thee. March,
march!" "Why hast thou said that, Ahasuerus? It
is thou who shalt march, even till the Last Judgment,
more than a thousand years. Go take thy sandals
and travelling raiment; wherever thou passest thou
shalt be known as the Wandering Jew. It is thou
who shalt find no seat whereon to rest, no mountain-spring
to slake thy thirst. In my place thou shalt
bear the burthen which I leave on the cross. For thy
thirst thou shalt drink what I have left at the bottom
of my cup. Others shall take my coat, thou shalt
inherit my eternal pain. Hyssop shall germinate in
thy staff, wormwood increase in thy leather bottle;
despair shall cling as the leather girdle about thy
loins. Thou shalt be the man that dies not. Thy age
shall be mine. To see thee pass the eagles shall perch
on their barn. The little birds shall half hide themselves
under the crest of the rocks. The star shall
bend beneath the cloud to watch thy tears falling drop
by drop in the abyss. I go to Golgotha; thou shalt
journey on from ruins to ruins, from kingdoms to
kingdoms, without finding thy Calvary."

This is about half of the sentence pronounced upon
Ahasuerus. A hand had written on his house, "The
Wandering Jew." Ahasuerus finds himself alone, and
calls for Jesus to return; he would speak only one
word more! After his sad soliloquy the angel
Michael appears, and bids him travel onward.
Ahasuerus enters his house once more and attempts
to rest and eat with his father and children, but he
cannot; he must go, despite their pleadings.

After a long and pathetic farewell to his family and
his home, Ahasuerus passes out to the Valley of
Jehoshaphat. Here, he says, he would build his hut
upon the rock could he only find some water. The
Valley bids him journey on: "I have neither well
nor cistern; those who dwell in my vale never thirst."
"Where are thy date-trees planted?" "I have none.
They who sojourn in my hill never hunger." "Find
in thy brushwood some herb to heal this wound in my
heart, which is like a point of iron?" "My simples
heal all pains, but not that of the heart in which a
thorn rests."

After much converse the Valley bids him adieu.
"Talk no more where the dead sleep. I am silent."
After that, whatever Ahasuerus says, Echo alone
replies. His requests are successively in the words
Jesus had addressed to him at his door, and Echo
repeats his own refusals.

The third "Day" is called <sc>Death</sc>. Death is
represented under the name of Mob. And now a
human spirit comes upon the scene--Rachel. As we
have seen the tender Jesus passing out of life to blend
with the remorseless elements, uttering the curses
which find their echo in the heartless hills, and the
winds whistling in the Valley of Death; so now, on
the other hand, we see a heart leaving the heavenly
realm that smiles above human agony to share the
earthly sorrow. In the presence of God and Christ,
and the heavenly host, one angel has forgotten the
wrongs of Christ so far as to shed a tear for Ahasuerus.
For that she is cast out of heaven, banished to the
earth, and made to dwell in the house of Mob (Death).
Rachel and Ahasuerus meet, neither knowing anything
of the other for a long time; they are in love
with each other; and for a time the drama somewhat
resembles that of Margaret and Faust, Mob taking
the part of Mephistopheles. There is a very beautiful
scene in which the Angel of Death (Mob) leads
Ahasuerus and Rachel into the cathedral at Strasburg.
There the mighty shades, royal and papal, demand of
Ahasuerus his name. He will not utter it; but
Christ speaks from the stained window and declares
him to be the Wandering Jew. The dead curse
Ahasuerus, the cathedral curses him; but Rachel
pleads for him. While demons flash their flames
around, Rachel cries: "Be blessed, Ahasuerus!
Mercy for him, Lord; open Thy heaven! Are these
the angels that watch at the gate of Paradise?
Angels, angels, open for me the gate; there is also a
place for Ahasuerus, is there not? Oh, how flaming
are their swords! Oh, how heavy their bolts! Come,
come, Ahasuerus: the stars of Paradise are rising
beyond the threshold!"

Another <i>motif</i> from Goethe's Faust rises in the
fourth "Day," the Day of Judgment, where Rachel
and Ahasuerus (whom she calls Joseph) are seen in a
desert, beside a waste ocean in the distance, and a
ruin emblematic of the world now in ruins. Ahasuerus
has exhausted every experience, except that of being
loved by Heaven. Rachel tells him that her Christ
is a divine sea of love, into which they may together
plunge and lose all memories and all longings. As
Faust's contract with Mephistopheles holds the latter
to bring him to an hour when he shall desire nothing
beyond, an hour to which he shall say, "Stay, thou
art fair!" so Ahasuerus is moved only by the pledge
of his angel Rachel that no desire can arise beyond
the divine Love. There is no water near; so there
in the desert Ahasuerus kneels, and Rachel baptizes
him with her tears.

As the world comes up before the seat of Judgment--cities,
ages, continents, islands--curses fall on
Ahasuerus. Rome, Babylon, Athens, the Highway,
repeat the sentences of his doom in Jerusalem; the
Mountain offers to be his Calvary; the Forest proffers
him a Cross, and the Rivers would give him gall.
But Christ speaks more kindly. Of all the universe
Ahasuerus and Rachel now only remain. Christ
offers now to give him his home in the East; but
Ahasuerus says he does not desire it. "I ask life, not
repose. Instead of the steps of my house of Calvary,
I wish to ascend without pause the stairway of the
Universe." "Art thou not weary from thy first
journey?" "Thy hand, rising over me, has already
dried my sweat. With thy benediction, I depart
this evening towards those future summits where
thou already dwellest." "But who will follow thee?"
A voice of the Universe breaks in, "Not we! If
thou wilt, we will return on our steps; but we cannot
mount higher. Our wild steeds, our waves, our
tempests are weary." Rachel says, "I! I will follow
him; my heart is not weary." Whereon the Universe
cries, "A woman has lost me, a woman has saved
me!" "Yes," declares Christ, "this voice has saved
thee, Ahasuerus. I bless thee, the pilgrim of coming
worlds, and the second Adam. Return me the burden
of the Earth's pains.... Journey thou from life to
life, world to world, from one divine city to another;
and when, after eternity, thou shalt have arrived at
circle on circle of the infinite summit whither all
things move, whither tend the souls and the years, the
peoples and the stars, thou shalt cry to star, to people
and universe, if they would pause, <i>Climb on, climb
for ever: it is here!</i>"

The epic closes with an impressive Epilogue. Christ
is alone in the vault of the firmament. "Since the
hour when Ahasuerus returned my Cup, the wound has
come again to my side; my tears fall into the abyss....
The heavens are empty; in the firmament I am alone.
One after another the angels have all folded their wings,
like the eagle when it is old. My mother Mary is
dead: my father Jehovah has said from his couch,
'Christ, my age is on me. I have lived enough of the
ages; the worlds burthen me to lift.... I am cold....
I am weary.... I thirst. My age is too great;
I see no more the light of thy aureole. Go! thy father
is dead.'... The firmament has cast its god from
its branch, as the fig-tree its leaves.... Farewell,
worlds, stars, dews of the morning and evening, which
have saluted me by name when I was a child.... Is
it true? in the night, in the day, afar, near, is there no
one?' Echo answers, 'None.' 'Life, truth, falsehood,
love, hate, gall and vinegar mingled in my pyx--yes, the
universe was I. I am a shadow; a shadow that for
ever passes; I am the tear that ever trickles, the sigh
ever renewed, the death that ever agonises; I am the
Nothing that ever doubts of its doubt, the Negation
that ever re-denies itself.'" Eternity alone hears the
sorrow of Christ, but it cannot aid him to weep, its
eyes are dry; it cannot promise love to the orphan-worlds
he is leaving, for in its breast is neither love
nor hate. 'All is finished!' cries the universe-wanderer,
who has no Rachel's tear to baptize him.
'Lay me in the tomb of my Father. Be it so!'
Eternity speaks: 'For the Father and the Son I
have digged a grave in a frozen star which rolls
companionless, without light. The Night, beholding
that pale star, shall say, 'This is the tomb of some
god.'"

Then Eternity crumbles the worlds, the sphinx, and
even the void, ending with a triumphant <i>Moi</i>.

The romance of <i>The Wandering Jew</i>, by Eugene
Sue (1844), from which the majority of people have
derived what impressions they may have of the legend,
is so "sensational" that its value as an illustration of
the myth is concealed. Whether intentionally or not,
this novel, so far as the Jew appears in it, reproduces
very nearly the spirit of an Arabian legend which
belongs to the class discussed in this work. The story
of Al Khedr will be found in the Koran (xviii.). It
is said that Moses, having boasted of his knowledge,
was told by God of one wiser than himself; and
having found out this man (Al Khedr), he (Moses)
journeyed with him. But the aged man had exacted
from Moses a promise that he would not ask any
question, whatever he might see. Al Khedr commits
various crimes, and Moses cannot contain his indignation.
Al Khedr then reveals to him that each apparent
wrong he had done was a retribution, or a blessing in
disguise, telling him the story of each person who had
apparently suffered injustice. The Arabs have identified
Al Khedr with both Elias and St. George (who
they say, recovered life after being thrice slain). The
wisdom of Al Khedr therefore lies in his continuity of
existence. He represents the primitive conception
of a particular providence, seeing the end of events
from the beginning. They who have perused the
history of a single family whose records have been
preserved for several generations, may sometimes feel,
with Browning's Luria,

/p
            "The only fault's with time:
All men become good creatures--but so slow!"
p/

It takes the life of a family to round out and complete
the events and incidents which its individual
members often find so out of joint, and which have
baffled the efforts of this or that generation to set
them right. And since the general pressure of the
aggregate members of the family, in all its generations,
is toward the better conditions, the tendency is
such as to suggest a providential guidance by the
Sleepless and Eternal. This is reflected in Al Khedr;
and the Eternal Jew of Eugene Sue is related to him.
In the drama built of this novel, which I saw well performed
recently as "All for Gold" in the Surrey
Theatre, the tableaus of the Wanderer were quite impressive.
He appears on a peak of Arctic snow, with
the Northern Light behind him; his doom, as that of
his race, was recalled in a certain reddish hue of beard
and raiment, and he speaks of the children--who, seeming
so helpless, are struggling successfully as unconsciously
for their bequest with the hidden powers of
Jesuitism--as representatives of a family which represents
the history of humanity.

Wherever Ahasuerus moves he leaves the sign of
the cross on his track--the last departing glimpse of
the mark of Cain. Herodias, his fellow-sufferer,
comes up to the Arctic region on the American side--a
notable incident when it is remembered (see IX.),
that her myth is mainly Spanish and survives
chiefly in Spanish America. Eugene Sue brings both
of the Wanderers to rest. Herodias enters the Abbey
of "St. John the Beheaded;" exhausted she sinks
before his image. Weary, footsore, as she had never
felt before, even when passing over fiery lava, sandy
desert, or Arctic icefields, athirst, and in pain, she
looks into a fountain and observes the traces of age
in her features. Her youth, which had seemed endless,
has passed. Her expiation ends at the feet of
the image of him her guilt had destroyed. She implores
the forgiveness of God for Ahasuerus also.
The Wandering Jew, meanwhile, has climbed Calvary
and sits down at the feet of an image of Jesus there.
Suddenly he perceives that the face looks upon him
as if it were alive, with gentleness and compassion.
Ahasuerus prays and is pardoned. Ahasuerus and
Herodias are finally seen together, under a shelter,
at peace, awaiting longed-for and approaching
death.

In Ahasuerus, Sue represents the Workingman, an
outcast from heaven under sentence of drudgery,
finding at last release from oppression. Herodias is
Woman, delivered at last from her political slavery.

So, in their widely differing spheres, have Quinet
and Eugene Sue given a nineteenth-century refrain to
the seventeenth century song:

/p
"Mais toujours le soleil se lève,
       Toujours, toujours.
 Tourne la terre où moi je cours,
 Toujours, toujours, toujours, toujours!"
p/

M. Pierre Dupont has written a poetical version
of our legend to accompany G. Doré's designs (published
by Michel Lévy in 1856). But, as Champfleury
says, the imaginatively created Jew of M. Doré, and
the modernised narrative of M. Dupont, are very
uninteresting compared with the rude pictures of the
folk-books, and the quaint simplicity of the folk
ballads. The figure of the Wandering Jew which
Kaulbach introduced into his picture of the siege of
Jerusalem might, as a painting, be regarded as somewhat
related to the New Ahasuerus of the poets, but
it is a subject that still invites artistic treatment.
And how suggestive of artistic effects the legend is
may be judged by the next and last French work to
be considered here: <i>La Mort du Juif-Errant. Par
Edouard Grenier.</i>

This poem was first published, separately, in 1857,
but afterwards included in its author's <i>Petits Poëmes</i>,
of which the fourth edition is before me. It is a
beautiful and pathetic poem, and treats the story
subjectively. The poet describes himself as having
escaped from the haunts of men, and built a little
hermitage far away in the mountain solitudes. One
evening, when he had been watching the fading
splendours of sunset, the signs of a storm appeared.
The labourers had hastened homeward, the herds
sought their shelter, the birds their nests. He then
beheld a solitary wayfarer moving on, and asked him
to enter, informing him that, in the direction he was
going, he could reach no house until morning, and
pointing to the increasing menaces of the storm.
The traveller turned upon him a burning eye and said,
"Thou knowest not the wayfarer whose steps thou
wouldst stay. Why, detained by thy request, should
I enter with thee thy hospitable door, if my name,
when pronounced, must freeze thy welcome, and
force me to repass thy threshold?" "Whatever thy
name or lot, yet must this roof shelter thee this
night." The Wanderer accepts. The poet draws a
striking picture of his guest's strange and noble
appearance. The traveller is shown a fountain where
he may bathe; a repast is then spread before him.
Afterwards the poet inquires the name and country of
his guest, who turns pale, and with a sigh answers,
"I am called Ahasuerus; I am the Wandering Jew."
Seeing the poet's shudder, the Wanderer rises, thanks
him for his hospitality, and says, "The cursed one
blesses thee," then starts up to resume his journey.
But the poet holds him. "It is not I who am charged
with thy punishment." He forbids Ahasuerus to go
out into the storm. The Wanderer says, "The beasts
of the field and the birds of the air have their retreats
from the rain and lightning, but the Proscribed One
hath not where to lay his head." He heeds not the
storm, but the voice which above it cries, "Still
march! For thee alone neither repose nor death.
March for ever! The justice of God has not had its
full course." But when the poet has detained him,
and as they sit together, this harsh voice for the first
time is not heard. He asks if the divine justice can
have become weary? The poet bids him hope. The
lamp is lit, and the poet entreats Ahasuerus to
instruct his youth. He who has explored so many
regions, seen so many peoples, traversed the earth--what
a sublime destiny!--can tell much to him who,
bound to one little spot, can only dream of such far
realms, which he has longed to see. Ahasuerus tells
him the earth is so small, his desire would soon be
calmed, could he explore it. Each corner of nature
offers the universe as in miniature. With the blue
heaven above, and a soul within, he may unite the
image of the real with the infinite dream. Earth, air,
heaven, man, are everywhere the same. But, the poet
says, life is so short; man does but begin to peruse
the universe when death closes his eyes; while for
him--the Wanderer--length of days have opened the
treasures of knowledge; man, time, lands and ages,
have no secrets for him. Ahasuerus bids the poet
undeceive himself: each man receives in his mind
what his forerunners have traced. "Step by step,
day by day, century by century, along with humanity,
I have wearily climbed the painful ladder on whose
last rung God has placed thee." They have journeyed
the same road, but he--the Wanderer--as a pioneer,
has had to travel for ages on foot, over stones, the
course which the man of the present passes in his
chariot in a day.

In the third canto the Wanderer gives the poet an
account of his wanderings. At first he had not believed
in his doom; then, when he began to contemplate
the possibility of it, he entered into all manner
of dissipation to forget himself. Finally, in the
mournful Valley of Jehoshaphat, he turned upon the
pursuing phantom and faced it. "Is it then such a
terrible thing to live for ever? What have I lost?
Death. What everybody is trying to do! Are not
all aiming to live eternally as God in heaven?" He is
elated at his prospect; he will have glory, gold, bend
nations under his sceptre. Perhaps he will be the
Messiah himself!

But the Wanderer's wife, passionately loved, slowly
parts from his heart, withers of age, and dies in his
young arms. The torture of that gradual decay of
the one he loved is portrayed. His sons, as they
grow in years, dread him, hate him, try to poison him;
and then leave him in horror or remorse for other
lands. Of his family one alone remains, a beloved
son. But this last child's heart even grows cold to
him. Its life sinks; its colour departs; its face becomes
thin, corpse-like. O horror! he sees before
him, in the dying child, the very face of Jesus, whom
he had insulted! The child dies on the day and hour
of the anniversary of Christ's death.

After many wanderings Ahasuerus finds himself in
the Colosseum at Rome, there seated in the moonlight.
He had seen that great edifice built by Jews,
stone by stone, while their own beloved Jerusalem fell
to dust. As in the great Roman ruin he is meditating
upon the vicissitudes he has witnessed, the
<i>Angelus</i> sounds forth; the stars, the dew, all nature
started in chorus, and said, "Repent!" He looks
upon the crucifix amid that circle--triumphantly
raised there, where he had seen Christians torn by
lions. As he was looking upon that figure a well-remembered
voice came to him from it, "Why fly
from me? Thy sole refuge is in my love." Then he
there knelt, crying, "O Christ! thou hast conquered
me!" Then his first relief came in tears, and an ineffable
peace descended in his heart. From that time
he did not suffer as one disinherited; he even felt a
delicious pain in his expiation; he lived, suffered and
loved along with humanity. He now comprehended
the enormity of his crime, which God had pursued so
relentlessly: it was not his insult to Divinity, but his
lese-humanity. He now felt that he might hope that
his expiation would be complete, and in the last day
he would find repose in the love of Christ.

In the fifth and last Canto the poet entreats the
Wanderer to give him a description of Jesus personally,
of whom he has so long dreamed--his look,
manner, voice. When he has ended this appeal there
is a knock at his door, and a stranger enters. Ahasuerus
at once recognises him, and kneels, clasping his
feet and bathing them with his tears. Jesus says to
him, "Friend! weep no more! Since thy touched
heart comprehends its sin and washes it away in
tears; since the man outraged by thee as much as
the God is now thy brother; since thy heart loves, I
bring pardon, the reward of repentance. Be happy!
Now, thou canst at last die."

In the morning a shepherd coming to the poet's
hermitage found two forms lying prostrate, both apparently
dead. The poet was slowly brought to life,
but Ahasuerus was dead. On his face was a smile of
celestial sweetness and calm felicity. On a bier made
of larches the poet and the shepherd bore the dead
body of the Wanderer to its place of rest. They
bore it to the summit of the highest mountain. Beyond
the trees they passed, beyond the bushes, and
where the grass became scant. Into a cloud they
entered, upward and onward bore him, till they came
to the blue foot of a glacier. On a little couch of
moss they laid the body while they dug a grave; as
they covered the Wanderer's form their last vision
was of the smile still shining, or even happier, upon
his face.

/p
"Ce vieux corps, fatigué par vingt siècles d'effort,
 Goûtait encore mieux le bienfait de la mort.
 Et c'est là qu'il repose, inconnu, solitaire,
 Perdu dans la nuée au-dessus de la terre!
 Nul monument funèbre attirant le regard,
 Ne révèle sa tombe au pas du montagnard.
 Le glacier qui défend cette gorge isolée
 En est le seul gardien et le seul mausolée.
 Nulle épouse, nul fils n'y sanglote sur lui,
 Et la seul rosée y vient pleurer la nuit.
 Nul mortel ne connaît sa demeure dernière,
 Personne, excepté moi, n'y versa de prière,
 Et seul l'aigle se pose à la cime où ses os
 Savourent dans mort un éternel repos.
p/

It is interesting to contrast this peaceful end of
Grenier's Ahasuerus with the invincible Wanderer of
Shelley. Nevertheless, the Ahasuerus of this poem
yields only to a tender appeal from Christ--himself
the bound victim of an eternal curse. Another poem
may yet be written which shall show Jesus not to
have pronounced the doom upon the poor shoemaker,
but to have known so much of Jahve's vindictive disposition
as to foretell it, and ultimately coming to an
understanding with Ahasuerus as the fellow-victim of
an eternal curse. They might be shown buried together
by the compassionate poet and shepherd where
the foiled eagle of Jove, surviving from its feast on
Prometheus, could not reach them, and the glacier-heart
of deified power could freeze and crush them no
more. This, for one of the two, would be a happier
fate than survival in the satirical song still sung in
France--

/p
"Jésus la bonté même
 Lui dit en soupirant,
 Tu marcheras toi-même
 Au moins pour trois milles ans,
 Tu finiras tes peines
 Au dernier jugement."

XVII.

THE NEW AHASUERUS IN ENGLAND.


The old Ahasuerus had his day in England. While
he was personally wandering about the world, however,
in the guise of the pious pretender, pouring his
cant into every long ear he could find, clever English
writers began to utilise him. The earliest work (1640),
<i>The Wandering Jew telling Fortunes to Englishmen</i>,
was a fair satire upon some features of London in
that time. The name of the Jew is Gad Ben-Arod
Ben-Balaam Ben-Alimoth Ben-Baal Ben-Gog Ben-Magog.
The next work that followed (1797) was an
amusing drama. It is entitled <i>The Wandering Jew,
or Love's Masquerade</i>, by Andrew Franklin. A surly
old guardian, disgusted with the young beaux seeking
his ward's hand, has vowed that he will give her to
the most aged man to be found in England. The
lover most favoured by the young lady conspires with
her to have an announcement of the presence of the
Wandering Jew in London, and then presents himself
in that disguise as Mr. Mathusalem. He is attended
by his equally aged servant, Juba, in whose anachronisms
the fun mainly consists. Juba, despite all
efforts on Mr. Mathusalem's part to make him more
reticent, is voluminous in his reminiscences; among
other things, he tells about Romulus and Remus, and
relates that, when he was at the baptism of the twins,
their mother threw a basin of tea at him for saying
that Remus was the prettier of the two.

In 1799 appeared the novel <i>St. Leon</i>, by William
Godwin. It is not a very interesting work now, whatever
it may have been at the time. The plot of it is,
that a gentleman, who, through gambling, has sunk
into poverty and plunged his family in distress,
obtains from an uncanny old man the secret of recovering
youth and obtaining money whenever he
needs it. But he has vowed secrecy. He returns to
his family, but is not recognised. He is cut off from
the old sympathies. The novel speedily carries
interest away from St. Leon to other persons, and
ends without any account of his end, nor does it even
carry St. Leon beyond the lives of his children. The
romance might have been suggested by any traditional
type of longevity, such as the Hindu Dnyaneshvar,
found in his tomb reading his Commentaries 300
years after apparent death; or Artesius, the Arabian
alchemist, said to have, by his art, prolonged his life
1025 years, or Alkazwini, who also lived præternaturally
long. The preface, however, contains an
interesting citation, which gives its actual origin:--"The
following passage from a work, said to be
written by the late Dr. John Campbel, and entitled
<i>Hermippus Redivivus</i>, suggested the first hint of the
present performance: 'There happened in the year
1687 an odd accident at Venice, that made a very
great stir then, and which I think deserves to be
rescued from oblivion. The great freedom and ease
with which all persons who make a good appearance
live in that city is known sufficiently to all who are
acquainted with it; such will not, therefore, be surprised
that a stranger, who went by the name of
Signor Gualdi, and who made a considerable figure
there, was admitted into the best company, though
nobody knew who or what he was. He remained at
Venice for some months, and three things were remarked
in his conduct. The first was, that he had a
small collection of fine pictures, which he readily
showed to anybody that desired it; the next, that he
was perfectly versed in all arts and sciences, and spoke
on every subject with such readiness and sagacity as
astonished all who heard him; and it was, in the third
place, observed that he never wrote or received any
letter, never desired any credit, or made use of bills of
exchange; but paid for everything in ready money,
and lived decently, though not in splendour.

"'This gentleman met one day at the coffee-house
with a Venetian nobleman, who was an extraordinary
good judge of pictures; he had heard of Signor
Gualdi's collection, and in a very polite manner desired
to see them, to which the other very readily
consented. After the Venetian had viewed Signor
Gualdi's collection, and expressed his satisfaction by
telling him he had never seen a finer, considering the
number of pieces of which it consisted--he cast his
eye by chance over the chamber-door, where hung a
picture of this stranger. The Venetian looked upon
it, and then upon him. "This picture was drawn for
you, sir," says he to Signor Gualdi, to which the other
made no answer but by a low bow. "You look," continued
the Venetian, "like a man of fifty, and yet I
know this picture to be of the hand of Titian, who has
been dead one hundred and thirty years. How is this
possible?" "It is not easy," said Signor Gualdi
gravely, "to know all things that are possible; but
there is certainly no crime in my being like a picture
drawn by Titian." The Venetian easily perceived, by
his manner of speaking, that he had given the stranger
offence, and therefore took his leave. He could not
forbear speaking of this in the evening to some of his
friends, who resolved to satisfy themselves by looking
upon the picture the next day. In order to have an
opportunity of doing so, they went to the coffee-house
about the time that Signor Gualdi was wont to come
thither; and not meeting him, one of them, who had
often conversed with him, went to his lodgings to inquire
after him, when he heard that he had set out
an hour before for Vienna. This affair made a great
noise, and found a place in all the newspapers of that
time.'"

It is probable that not only <i>St. Leon</i>, but the
<i>Bassevilliana</i> of Vincenzo Monti had influence in
exciting the English imagination with legends of this
character. A translation of this Italian poem, by the
Rev. Henry Boyd, was published in London in 1805.
It is the story of a "Soul's Doom," founded on the
murder of the French minister, Basseville, in Rome,
near the end of the last century. The soul of Basseville
is condemned to wander over the French provinces,
and behold the desolations caused by the
revolution and its retributions. The Spirit of the
Abyss is forbidden to clutch Basseville. An angel
says to the soul:

/p
"Fear not; thou art not doomed to sip the wave
   Of black Avernus, which who tastes, resigned
 All hope of change, becomes the demon's slave;
   But Heaven's high justice, nor in mercy blind,
 Nor in security scrupulous to gauge
   Each blot, each wrinkle, of the human mind,
 Has written on the adamantine page,
   That thou no joys of paradise mayst know,
   Till punished be of France the guilty rage."
p/

Both <i>St. Leon</i> and "The Soul's Doom" might have
been read by those comrades in distress, Shelley and
Medwin, for whom seventy years ago Oxford Christianity,
and homes inspired by it, had nothing better
than wanderings about London under a curse. They
took up the subject, Medwin says, when Shelley
was fifteen. Of the poem, as it now stands, in the
edition of Chatto and Windus, Shelley wrote but a
few lines; but I think that amidst its rhapsodical
rubbish a scholarly expression or illustration may
here and there be found traceable to Shelley. There
is evidence of Shelley's divining-rod in the allusions
to some of the more significant legends concerning
Ahasuerus which had attracted the attention of
several German poets. There is in the opening some
resemblance to the scene in Southey's <i>Curse of
Kehama</i>. Where, in the latter, the young Hindu
woman is brought forward to perish on the funeral-pyre,
in Shelley's poem a sinning novice is dragged to
the "fatal shrine," from which she is rescued by the
mysterious traveller. This horseman, hastening to
Padua,

/p
"Wraps his mantle around his brow,
As if to hide his woes."
p/

In his tale, he says:

/p
"A burning cross illumed my brow,
 I hid it with a fillet grey."
p/

This Cross enables him to command fiends. To
Paulo, who has rescued her, Rosa the novice has
given herself. Victorio, her lover, summons a witch-demon,
and to her consigns his soul to obtain a philtre
which will secure Rosa's love. But when he has
administered it she dies.

Is the resemblance mentioned between this
<i>Wandering Jew</i> and the <i>Curse of Kehama</i> accidental?
The Medwin-Shelley poem was unable to reach the
light for which it struggled in 1810. It was published
in <i>Frazer's Magazine</i> in 1831. But soon after
it was written, Shelley shows great eagerness to get
Southey's poem, which had been announced, and
twice writes to the bookseller, Stockdale, for it in
December, 1810. In 1812, while at Keswick with his
young wife, Shelley made the acquaintance of Southey,
if not before. In the poem of Southey, the young
Indian casts down the idol before which the woman
is about to be burned, which corresponds to the blow
given to Christ by Ahasuerus. The curse is artificially
modified, and may have been suggested by the
sentence on Cain, "Behold now art thou cursed from
the earth." The doom on the iconoclast is that on
him shall fall neither the rain nor the sunshine, nor
any of the influences of nature.

There would seem to be little doubt that <i>St. Leon</i>
inspired Shelley's <i>St. Irvyne, the Rosicrucian</i>, or rather
Ginotti, with his elixir of life, whose only "survival"
is in Bulwer's <i>Zanoni</i>. The "gigantic Ginotti" dies
through the wicked Wolfstein; but Shelley was
particular in pointing out that "he did not die by
Wolfstein's hand, but by the influence of that natural
magic which, when the secret was imparted to the
latter, destroyed him." The longevity is here not a
doom. But once, as Shelley was walking through
Lincoln's Inn Fields, he picked up a "dirty and torn"
work, which contained Schubart's "Rhapsody" of
Ahasuerus, elsewhere mentioned. Hogg was quite
mistaken in affirming that Shelley's account was an
invention. Full information on this point may be
found in Rossetti's Shelley (vol. i. p. 434). The German
poem had appeared in a magazine called the <i>German
Museum</i>, in 1802. The Wandering Jew thus became
a type in Shelley's mind, and repeatedly appears in
his works. In Alastor he uses the Wanderer as an
illustration.

/p
                          "Oh that God,
Profuse of poisons, would concede the chalice
Which but one living man has drained, who now,
Vessel of deathless wrath, a slave that feels
No proud exemption in the blighting curse
He bears, over the world wanders for ever,
Lone as incarnate death!"
p/

It is, however, in <i>Queen Mab</i> that we find the real
form which arose before Shelley out of Schubart's
small casket, fished up from the muddy ocean of
London. Schubart's Ahasuerus whines and is pardoned.
Shelley's Ahasuerus is a Titan, who prefers
the sharp vulture-beak and the chain to any surrender
to the Christian Jove. Believing as I do that Cain
was originally a Semitic Prometheus,--as first of those
who began removal of Jahve's curse on the earth by
agriculture and working in metals,--I find it remarkable
that Shelley, outcast from college and home in
early youth because of his atheism, should recognise
this feature in the distant successor of Cain.

/p
        "A strange and woe-worn wight,
      Arose beside the battlements,
        And stood unmoving there:
      His inessential figure cast no shade
        Upon the golden floor;
      His port and mien bore mark of many years,
        And chronicles of untold ancientness
        Were legible within his beamless eye:
      Yet his cheek bore the mark of youth;
      Freshness and vigour knit his manly frame;
      The wisdom of old age was mingled there
        With youth's primeval dauntlessness;
          And inexpressible woe,
      Chastenéd by fearless resignation, gave
      An awful grace to his all-speaking brow.

  <i>Spirit.</i>--Is there a God?

  <i>Ahasuerus.</i>--Is there a God!--ay, an Almighty God,
And vengeful as almighty! Once his voice
Was heard on earth: earth shudder'd at the sound;
The fiery-visaged firmament expressed
Abhorrence, and the grave of nature yawn'd,
To swallow all the dauntless and the good,
That dared to hurl defiance at his throne,
Girt as it was with power. None but slaves
Survived--cold-blooded slaves, who did the work
Of tyrannous Omnipotence; whose souls
No honest indignation ever urged
To elevated daring, to one deed
Which gross and sensual self did not pollute.
These slaves built temples for the omnipotent fiend,
Gorgeous and vast: the costly altars smoked
With human blood, and hideous pæans rang,
Through all the long-drawn aisles.
      *      *      *      *      *
"O Spirit! centuries have set their seal,
On this heart of many wounds, and loaded brain,
Since the Incarnate came: humbly he came,
Veiling his horrible godhead
In the shape of man; scorn'd by the world, his name unheard,
Save by the rabble of his native town,
Even as a parish demagogue. He led
The crowd; he taught them justice, truth, and peace,
In semblance; but he lit within their souls
The quenchless flame of zeal, and blest the sword
He brought on earth, to satiate with the blood
Of truth and freedom his malignant soul
At length his mortal frame was led to death.
I stood beside him: on the torturing cross
No pain assailed his unterrestrial sense;
And yet he groaned. Indignantly I summ'd
The massacres and miseries which his name
Had sanction'd in my country, and I cried,
'Go! go!' in mockery.
A smile of godlike malice reillumined
His fading lineaments,--'I go,' he cried,
'But thou shalt wander o'er the unquiet earth,
Eternally.'--The dampness of the grave,
Bathed my imperishable front. I fell,
And long lay tranced upon the charméd soil.
When I awoke hell burned within my brain,
Which stagger'd on its seat; for all around
The mouldering relics of my kindred lay,
Even as the Almighty's ire arrested them,
And in their various attitudes of death,
My murder'd children's mute and eyeless skulls,
Glared ghastlily upon me.

                          But my soul,
From sight and sense of the polluting woe
Of tyranny, had long learn'd to prefer
Hell's freedom to the servitude of heaven.
Therefore I rose, and dauntlessly began
My lonely and unending pilgrimage,
Resolved to wage unweariable war
With my almighty tyrant, and to hurl
Defiance at his impotence to harm,
Beyond the curse I bore. The very hand
That barr'd my passage to the peaceful grave
Has crush'd the earth to misery, and given
Its empire to the chosen of his slaves.
      *      *      *      *      *
"Thus have I stood--through a wild waste of years
Struggling with whirlwinds of mad agony,
Yet peaceful, and serene, and self-enshrined,
Mocking my powerless tyrant's horrible curse
With stubborn and unalterable will;
Even as the giant oak, which heaven's fierce flame
Had scathed in the wilderness, to stand
A monument of fadeless ruin there;
Yet peacefully and movelessly it braves
The midnight conflict of the wintry storm,
As in the sunlight's calm it spreads
Its worn and wither'd arms on high,
To meet the quiet of a summer's morn.

              The Fairy waved her hand:
              Ahasuerus fled
Fast as the shapes of mingled shade and mist,
That lurk in the glens of a twilight grove,
              Flee from the morning beam:
The matter of which dreams are made
Not more endowed with actual life
Than this phantasmal portraiture
Of wandering human thought."
p/

This Ahasuerus is not only the fellow Titan of Prometheus,
but he is the New Ahasuerus-Prometheus
who had his fire to bring and his doom to suffer in
England. The events of Shelley's life between 1812,
when he probably wrote this part of <i>Queen Mab</i>, and
the latter part of 1814, added new curses to the
eternal wanderings of the Jew. These appear in that
sufficiently wild fragment entitled <i>The Assassins</i>,
written in Switzerland, 1814, from which the subjoined
passage is selected:

"A young man named Albedir, wandering in the
woods, was startled by the screaming of a bird of prey,
and, looking up, saw blood fall, drop by drop, from
among the intertwined boughs of a cedar. Having
climbed the tree, he beheld a terrible and dismaying
spectacle. A naked human body was impaled on the
broken branch. It was maimed and mangled horribly--every
limb bent and bruised into frightful distortion,
and exhibiting a breathing image of the most sickening
mockery of life. A monstrous snake had scented
its prey from among the mountains--and above
hovered a hungry vulture. From amidst the mass of
desolated humanity two eyes, black and excessively
brilliant, shone with an unearthly lustre. Beneath the
blood-stained eyebrows their steady rays manifested
the serenity of an immortal power, the collected
energy of a deathless mind, spell-secured from dissolution.
A bitter smile of mingled abhorrence
and scorn distorted his wounded lip--he appeared
calmly to observe and measure all around--self-possession
had not deserted the shattered mass of
life.

"The youth approached the bough on which the
breathing corpse was hung. As he approached, the
serpent reluctantly unwreathed his glittering coils,
and crept towards his dark and loathsome cave. The
vulture, impatient of his meal, fled to the mountain,
that re-echoed with his hoarse screams. The cedar-branches
creaked with their agitating weight, faintly,
as the dismal wind arose. All else was deadly
silent.

"At length a voice issued from the mangled man.
It rattled in hoarse murmurs from his throat and lungs--his
words were the conclusion of some strange,
mysterious soliloquy. They were broken and without
apparent connection, completing wide intervals of
inexpressible conceptions.

"'The great tyrant is baffled, even in success. Joy,
joy to his tortured foe! Triumph to the worm which
he tramples under his feet! Ha! his suicidal hand
might dare as well abolish the mighty frame of things!
Delight and exultation sit before the closed gates of
death! I fear not to dwell beneath their black and
ghastly shadow. Here thy power may not avail!
Thou createst--'tis mine to ruin and destroy. I was
thy slave--I am thy equal, and thy foe. Thousands
tremble before thy throne, who, at my voice, shall dare
to pluck the golden crown from thy unholy head.'
He ceased. The silence of noon swallowed up his
words. Albedir clung tighter to the tree--he dared
not for dismay remove his eyes. He remained mute
in the perturbation of mute and creeping horror.

"'Albedir,' said the same voice--'Albedir, in the
name of God, approach! He that suffered me to fall
watches thee. The gentle and merciful spirits of sweet
human love delight not in agony and horror. For
pity's sake, approach! In the name of thy good God,
approach, Albedir!' The tones were mild and clear
as the responses of Æolian music. They floated to
Albedir's ear like the warm breath of June that lingers
in the lawny groves, subduing all to softness. Tears
of tender affection started into his eyes."

The "Assassins" are something like Schiller's
"Robbers," outlaws better than the laws that have
branded them. In <i>Hellas</i>, Ahasuerus, though still
appropriately responding to a summons from the
Moslem Antichrist, is an impersonation of human
thought as raised by long experience to a prophetic
power. The idea is substantially the same as that
which we have seen underlying the myths of Enoch
and Teiresias, while it goes beyond them in its suggestion
that knowledge, living over the ages past, and
imagination attaining to the farthest outcome of present
tendencies, can make for the being of a day an
eternal existence. Ahasuerus says to Mahmud:

/p
                "All is contained in each.
Dodona's forest to an acorn's cup
Is that which has been, or will be, to that
Which is--the absent to the present. Thought
Alone, and its quick elements, Will, Passion,
Reason, Imagination, cannot die;
They are, what that which they regard appears,
The stuff whence mutability can weave
All that it hath dominion o'er, worlds, worms,
Empires, and superstitions."
p/

With true Shelleyan felicity Hassan describes this
Jew--

/p
                 "From his eye looks forth
A life of unconsumed thought which pierces
The present, and the past, and the to come ...
Some feign that he is Enoch."
p/

In the year 1820 appeared the novel in four
volumes, <i>Melmoth, the Wanderer</i>, by the Rev. Robert
Charles Maturin, author also of <i>Bertram</i>, a respectable
play, and several novels. Melmoth is a man
who has sold himself to Satan for the advantage of
a vast length of life, to which is added a power of
passing instantaneously, at will, from place to place.
The terms of his bond are that he may escape the
final doom of his soul, which is to pay for these
advantages, provided he can find anyone willing to
take the contract, with its benefits and penalty, off
his hands. The author's purpose appears to be to
show that no one would deliberately damn himself to
all eternity for any temporal advantage; though this
would seem to be rather "Irish," since his hero is just
that man. However, the hero is an exception that
proves the rule, for he goes about the world vainly
tempting the poor and needy to take his place.
Even a beautiful Indian maiden, who has fallen
desperately in love with him, will not surrender her
soul. Failing with all, he is carried off by the Devil.
The supposed date of this catastrophe is toward the
close of the eighteenth century.

The next work to be noticed at this point, and one
which the perusal of Shelley may have suggested, is
more distinctly based upon the legend of the
Wandering Jew; this is the Rev. George Croly's
<i>Salathiel: A Story of the Past, the Present, and the
Future</i>. This novel, in three volumes, appeared
anonymously in 1828. The spirit in which the
legend is treated in this work will sufficiently appear
by the following passages:

"Every sterner passion that disturbs our nature
was to rule in successive tyranny over my soul.

"Fearfully was the decree fulfilled.

"In revenge for the fall of Jerusalem, I traversed
the country to seek out an enemy of Rome. I found
in the Northern snows a man of blood: I stirred up
the soul of Alaric and led him to the sack of Rome.

"In revenge for the insults heaped upon the Jew
by the dotards and dastards of the city of Constantine,
I sought out an instrument of compendious
ruin: I found him in the Arabian sands, and poured
ambition into the soul of the enthusiast of Mecca.

"In revenge for the pollution of the ruins of the
Temple, I roused the iron tribes of the West, and at
the head of the Crusaders, expelled the Saracens. I
fed full on revenge, and I felt the misery of revenge!

"A passion for the mysteries of nature seized me.
I talked with the Alchemist. I wore away years in
the perplexities of the schoolmen; and I felt the
guilt and emptiness of unlawful knowledge.

"A passion for human fame seized me. A passion
for gold!...

"I found a bold Genoese. I led him to discover
the New World; with its metals I inundated the
Old; and to my own misery added the misery of two
hemispheres."

At length the eternal World-wanderer stands beside
the newly discovered Printing Press; again he
pays homage to Luther at his rise, and he attains a
faith in the progress of mankind. "At this hour
I see the dawn of things to whose glory the glory of
the Past is but a dream!"

Quite another Ahasuerus than Shelley's is represented
in Wordsworth's "<i>Song of the Wandering
Jew</i>," which somewhat resembles the idea of Müller,
already quoted, as indeed both do the old saying,
"The foxes have holes, the birds of the air have nests,
but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head."

/p
"Though the torrents from their fountains
   Roar down many a craggy steep,
 Yet they find among the mountains
   Resting-places calm and deep.

"Clouds that love through air to hasten,
   Ere the storm its fury stills,
 Helmet-like themselves will fasten
   On the heads of towering hills.

"What if through the frozen centre
   Of the Alps the chamois bound,
 Yet he has a home to enter
   In some nook of chosen ground.

"If on windy days the raven
   Gambol like a dancing skiff,
 Not the less she loves her haven
   In the bosom of the cliff.

"Though the sea-horse in the ocean
   Own no dear domestic cave,
 Yet he slumbers--by the motion
   Rocked of many a gentle wave.

"The fleet ostrich, till day closes,
   Vagrant over desert sands,
 Brooding on her eggs reposes
   When chill night that care demands.

"Day and night my toils redouble,
   Never nearer to the goal;
 Night and day, I feel the trouble
   Of the Wanderer in my soul."
p/

It would be interesting to know at just what period
of his life, or in which of his two lives, Wordsworth
wrote this "Song." Was it a memory of his dead
self, the radical that fell in the French Revolution?
Or did he write it when the sceptical wanderings of
other minds around him had become to his peaceful
soul, with no doom heavier than the liturgical round
of Grasmere Church, as imaginary as the "seven
whistlers on their nightly rounds," which his peasant-friend
heard, while overhead were heard those
"Gabriel's hounds" by ears that little knew they too
were fabled of Jews doomed by the Crucified? All
around Wordsworth in his home amid the Lakes
were the real wanderers. Before nearly every fine
mind living at the beginning of the last generation,
this Ahasuerus had risen as a spiritual type. Seven
times did Shelley evoke this form, and it was with
him when he wandered unrecognised past Rydal
Mount. Southey had known the meaning of it.
Byron had taken the side of Cain against him who in
Paradise permitted "the Serpent to creep in," and
seen in Prometheus, with "the wretched gift Eternity,"
the symbol of man's fate and force. De Quincey
had made acquaintance with such doomed wanderers
of rabbinical legend as "The Widow of Hebron."
From afar the sighings of "L. E. L." were heard in
fitful dreams of "The Undying One."

There came a terrible day when the children of the
Revolution recognised the inexorable Mother of
whom they were born. The old beliefs and ideas
in which good and honest people had lived so comfortably
were shrivelled up. It was not the half-way
heresy of the earlier time which believed it was
attaining a purer Christianity and a more glorious
immortality. These children of the Revolution
found the whole fabric of faith fallen to black
ruins. The youth went off light-hearted to college:
he came back heavy-hearted. Beside the old fireside
he sat once more, with the dear faces around
him and exile in his heart. He listened to the old
Bible, and knelt; but his mind was far away, and
had left him amid the innocent, a guilty, kneeling,
assenting phantasm. Then there began this Age of
Wandering; for the new mind could not yet get a
new heart, and could only wander about like the night-raven
of folk-lore, that ever seeks the Holy Sepulchre
for rest. Their voices may be heard in most of the
literature of the last generation, pathetic as the
appeal of deserted brides going about the street asking,
"Saw ye my Beloved?"--the only answer being endless
echoes of the question. Intellect seemed to them
a curse. By it they were at one stroke deprived alike
of faith in future and hope of present joys. Unfit for
usual avocations, unable to enter pulpits and professions
tainted with the discredited superstitions,
how well could they understand the doom of every
wanderer!

In the same year (1833) that Edgar Quinet--after
ten years of wandering in the effort to find some point
where he could catch a least ray of the old faith
that made his early home so sweet, only to discover
that his faith was gone out, not eclipsed--published
his <i>Ahasuerus</i>, Carlyle also, after like wanderings,
published his <i>Sartor Resartus</i>, with its story of
the "Sorrows of Teufelsdröckh." It was in that
same year, too, that Ralph Waldo Emerson, unable
to rest even in his Unitarian pulpit, escaping
from the clinging arms of his devoted congregation,
came across the ocean to converse with Carlyle, Coleridge,
and Wordsworth, and find if they could show
him any light on the great problems. Coleridge had
taken refuge with opium and orthodoxy. Wordsworth
entertained the young American Wanderer
with lamentations over the excess of intellectual
above moral culture in the modern world. But it was
in the far solitude of Nithsdale that he hoped to find
what he sought; for Carlyle had written an essay in
which he spoke of standing amid night, yet seeing
the faint signs of a new day-spring. "Here, straight
uprose that lone wayfaring man," wrote Carlyle afterwards;
but, alas, it was only to find at Craigenputtoch
(Hawk Hill) one preyed upon by the same
remorseless doubts. The personal hospitality was
beautiful. But when the young American, just bereaved
of his wife, sought some vision beyond the
grave, there was no help for him. He asked Carlyle
to what religious development those sentences about
a new day-spring pointed? The answer was that he
could not state that even to himself. Everyone, he
said, must find out his own path, and walk in it.

When Emerson parted from Carlyle and returned to
the New World, he found in its new life more than
his vanished faith: to emancipate slaves, and human
minds, and the moral genius of woman, and give the
People their opportunity to build the New World into
beauty and happiness--this he found was a religion
with eternal vistas opening from it, hopes fairer than
his faded heaven, a providence better than the Syrian
deity who had led the Old World into Red Seas, but
never through them to any Promised Land. But
Carlyle remained to wander to the last amid the
wrecks of his lost worlds.

"Poor Teufelsdröckh! Flying with Hunger always
parallel to him, and a whole Infernal Chase in his
rear; so that the countenance of Hunger is comparatively
a friend's! Thus must he, in the temper of
ancient Cain, or of the modern Wandering Jew, save
only that he feels himself not guilty and but suffering
the pains of guilt--wend to and fro with aimless
speed. Thus must he, over the whole surface of the
earth (by footprints) write his <i>Sorrows of Teufelsdröckh</i>;
even as the great Goethe, in passionate words,
must write his <i>Sorrows of Werther</i>, before the spirit
freed itself and he could become a Man. Vain, truly,
is the hope of your swiftest runner to escape from
his own shadow!"

Among all the Wanderers only one seemed to have
found a new heart atwin with his new intellect--he
alone loved and welcomed the new, and preferred the
vulture-beak that tears Prometheus, the loneliness of
Ahasuerus, to the favour of Jove, Jahve or Jesus.
Shelley alone was heard singing his matin of the
lark above ruins sadder than all the rest.




XVIII.

AHASUERUS VINCTUS.


Here before me is a formidable array of large--one
might almost say fat--volumes, which I have hardly
known whether to assign to England or Germany, but
conclude that they belong to both, and also to America,
and to the night-side of Protestantism everywhere.
They are entitled: <i>Chronicles, selected from the
originals, of Cartaphilus, the Wandering Jew, embracing
a period of nearly XIX. centuries. Now first
revealed to and edited by David Hoffman, Hon. J. U. D.
of Göttingen. In two series, each of three volumes.
London: Thomas Bosworth, 1853.</i> This book contains
a dedication, dated March 10, 1851, Upper Brook
Street, Grosvenor Square, to the author's brother,
Samuel Hoffman, Esq., of Baltimore, U. S. A. It
contains also a dedication, dated September, 1852,
Austin Friars, London, from Cartaphilus himself:
"To the Children of the Dispersion--Jehovah's
favoured people during so many ages, Christ's scattered
flock during so many more--these chronicles
are affectionately inscribed," etc.

There is nothing in these volumes which bear upon
the legendary Wandering Jew, except a tradition, incidentally
mentioned, that in 1539 he visited Cornelius
Agrippa, and was shown the face of Rebecca, whom
he had loved fifteen centuries before, in a magic mirror.
But the existence of such a book, embodying the
vulgar Protestant superstitions about the "dispersion"
and the gathering of the "chosen people;" the fact
that so much labour can be expended on these
notions by a man otherwise educated, the author
apparently of several legal works, are phenomena to
excite reflections. There is a good deal of suggestiveness,
too, in the link between Austin Friars and Grosvenor
Square. Cartaphilus, going his eternal round
with cry of "O' clo'!" has finally, it would appear, discovered
that he need only have his Judaism baptized
to be one of "Christ's flock," pastured as richly in the
fashionable Square.

But even more significant just now is the fact that
Germany is ready to supply the hand that can write
of the Jews as for ages "Jehovah's favoured people,"
and in the next moment be clenched to smite them as
an accursed race. So much this union of Cartaphilus
and Austin Friars with the Hon. Mr. Hoffman and
Grosvenor Square may mean for us, as we bid them
farewell, finding nothing further in their voluminous
sermons pertinent to our present inquiry or purpose.

Here are two pregnant facts. In various parts of
the East Jews manifest a superstitious dread of a
Christian's curse. On the other hand, for a long time
there prevailed among Christians a belief that an oath
taken in a Jewish synagogue was more binding and
efficient than one taken elsewhere.[40] Add these two
facts together, and their sum is in the following third
fact: on Wednesday, April 13, 1881, a petition
against the Jews was presented to the German Chancellor,
in twenty-six volumes, 14,000 sheets, and with
255,000 signatures.

[Footnote 40: <i>Superstition and Force.</i> By Henry C. Lea, p. 26. Philadelphia,
1878.]

Every signature to that most shameful document
which the nineteenth century has witnessed was set
there by--Judaism itself. It was Israel that taught
Christendom its black art of cursing. The Christian
idea of a Chosen People of Christ, commissioned to
make war upon other peoples as heathen, infidels,
hosts of Antichrist, is a precise transcript of the Judaic
idea of a Chosen People of Jahve, with commission to
put Gentiles to the edge of the sword. In the darkest
ages, when holocausts of Jews were offered in sacrifice
to a deified member of their race, the Christian might
have addressed his victim with a paraphrase of Shylock's
words, "If a Baalite disagreed with a Jew, what
was his humility? Slaughter. If a Jew disagree with
a Christian, what should his sufferance be by Jewish
example? Why, slaughter. The intolerance your
Testament teaches me I will execute, and it shall go
hard but, with the aid of my Testament, I will better
the instruction!"

When Moses Mendelssohn was asked, "When will
the Jews become Christians?" he answered, "When
the Christians cease to be Jews."

After Shakspeare had startled the world with a
suspicion that the Jew is a man, it still required a
hundred and fifty years, or thereabout, to awaken the
further suspicion that a Jew might be a good, even a
religious man. This revelation came through Lessing.
When he was coming of age, Lessing recognised the
injustice done to the Jews of Germany. Every Jew
entering Berlin was compelled to pay toll at Brandenburg
Gate. The meanest Christian might gain credit
by insulting or assaulting a Jew. Frederick the Great
could write, "Jesus was a Jew, yet we persecute the
Jews," but his wide toleration left that people unprotected.
Lessing wrote an early drama, <i>Die Juden</i>,
which touched gently on the matter. In it a wealthy
Jew of high character saves the life of a Christian
baron and his daughter. The baron desires the youth
to marry his daughter, but finding to what race and
religion he belongs, that, of course, is impossible. So
the drama ends. Why impossible? The answer to
that question had to be postponed. There are some
evils in this world which are like the birth-mark in
Nathaniel Hawthorne's story: the chemist succeeded
in extracting the birth-mark from his wife's face, but
the wife lay dead. When the mark of the cross disappears
from the Wanderer's brow, so that the
Christian who has branded him shall no longer say
as he passes, "He is a Jew," nor for that part from
his daughter's lover, Christianity will be dead. The
flower of Lessing's great heart and mind was <i>Nathan
the Wise</i>. The apologue of "The Three Rings," in
which the Jew, the Moslem, the Christian Templar,
raised above their bigotry by mutual human service
are seen in a tableau of charity, shone like the star of
a new religion over Germany. It is the "Ideal of
Religious Liberty," said Schwartz, Historian of
Modern Theology at Halle; "Truly can Deity be
said to pervade every line of Nathan," said Kuno
Fischer, of Jena University; while in it Strauss sees
one advancing the "Kingdom of God on earth."[41] Yet
even Lessing was still not equal to the idea of having
the Jewess marry the Christian. Just as we are
listening to hear the marriage-bells ring out for the
lovers, lo, they turn out to be brother and sister! So,
the religious equality having been proclaimed a
hundred and fifty years after Shakspeare had proclaimed
the human equality, Lessing leaves it to a
like time to establish the social equality of Jew and
Christian.

[Footnote 41: <i>Nathan the Wise.</i> From the German, with an introduction,
by R. Willis, M.D. London: Williams and Norgate.]

But was this line drawn altogether by the Christian?
Lessing's friendship with Moses Mendelssohn had
taught him otherwise. When Michaelis, the theologian,
read his early play, "The Jews," he wrote a criticism
in which he expressed a doubt whether an oppressed
and despised race could produce such a man as the
hero. Mendelssohn replied, and Lessing, enclosing
this reply to Michaelis, wrote concerning its author:
"He really is a Jew, a man of five-and-twenty, who,
without any instruction, has acquired great attainments
in languages, in mathematics, in philosophy,
in poetry. I foresee in him an honour to our nation,
if he is allowed to come to maturity by his co-religionists,
who have always displayed an unfortunate
spirit of persecution towards men like him." The
confirmation of this apprehension on the part of the
Jews' earliest champion in Germany may be found in
the enthusiasm which the next eminent Mendelssohn
put into his oratorio of "St. Paul."

Goethe tells us that he had intended to bring his
Wandering Jew to a meeting with Spinoza. The
great German had met with two illustrations of the
legend he did deal with, of Faust carried off by
demons. One was in the case of Lessing, who, for
his defence of Jews and his attack on historic
Christianity, had been piously impaled by a rumour
that Satan had appeared at his death-bed. The
other was in a tract he picked up in which Spinoza
was denounced as an infidel, and upon which was a
picture of the noble man, giving him diabolical
features. But, alas! Spinoza had been more a martyr
among his own people than among Christians.
Ahasuerus with the red cross on his brow would have
found Spinoza also a lonely wanderer, outcast from his
people, but not under any Christian doom.

Were Goethe alive, he would find Spinoza still in
Europe, and still a lonely wanderer amid the scowling
hatred of both Jew and Christian. He would find in
England, certainly, a steady tendency of synagogue-Judaism
to find its ally and support in the Christianity
which alone represents its ancient superstition
and bigotry. It is the orthodox Jew who on Saturday
sets the model of a Sabbath for the Christian to
copy on Sunday. When the parliamentary oath--half
Romish, half Jewish--is questioned, Jew and
Christian stand side by side in its defence, and
together seek to impose upon Englishmen of the
nineteenth century the theological test of belief in an
oath-bound and oath-guaranteeing deity in which no
educated man can possibly believe. The orthodox
male Jew thanks Jahve in his liturgy that he was not
made a woman; and the male Christian responds by
excluding women from political rights. While in
Germany the Christian persecutes the Jew as Antichrist,
in England the Jew persecutes the Antichristian
as Armillus. The Jew recognises a believer in
the Trinity as a true theist, and the Christian accepts
the Jewish worshipper of Jahve as a theist; and they
make common cause against the disbeliever in both
as a "miscreant," an "atheist." Some influential
Jews recently made an effort to "Boycott" the <i>Jewish
World</i> newspaper for its criticisms on Christianity.
From another "Jewish" quarter there came a sharp
cry of distress and anger because a scholar attempted
to prove that Jesus was not of the Jewish race!

It is a significant fact that the man of whom the
Jews of recent times have been proudest, the statesman
whom every Israelite in Europe was glad to aid
with his information and his wealth, was a Jew whose
circumcision had been subordinated to Christian
baptism. This combination of auspices--the heart of
an ancient Jew with the political advantages of a
Christian--made Lord Beaconsfield a symbolical
figure. It is only in its Christianised form that
Judaism can ever behold even a partial fulfilment of
its ancient dreams of worldly power. The theocracy
of Jahve is henceforth dependent for every shred of
its authority upon the golden sceptre of Christ.

Christ is for the present a monarch--in England the
last surviving sovereign whose rule is at all theocratic.
The Jews, as we have seen, were really saved from extermination
by powerful rulers who only hungered for
their money while the mob thirsted for their blood.
Fear of the populace was part of the heritage of the
Jew, transmitted by heredity. However bravely the
modern Jew--at least up to this generation--might
begin with the radicalism of his prophets, he was
pretty sure to develop into a supporter of strong
government; and there has hitherto, in most countries,
been always sufficient Christian intolerance to enable
that evolution to pass its embryonic phases without
arrest. Heine begins with revolutionism and atheism;
ends with worshipping Napoleon I. (whom he sees
protecting Jews along the Rhine), and God (of whose
existence he was convinced by the sense of smell while
mingling with the atheistical <i>ouvriers</i> in their Paris
clubs). Benjamin Disraeli begins with poetical eulogy
of regicide, and ends with turning a queen into an
empress. So far as this ancient reactionism can
survive into the immediate future, it must necessarily
be the ally of Christianity. The English Jews who
paid so large a sum to bring back Charles II. to his
throne, were represented by those who gathered to
the support of the Christian Lord Beaconsfield.

Lord Beaconsfield was for the Jews a triumph for
their race, but a humiliation for their religion. They
must needs find their leader in a family of apostates!
But the orthodox Jews knew well that this humiliation
was more than compensated to them in the new
resource which their christened leader opened for them
against their party of progress. Disraeli the Elder had
fled from the dry bones of Judaism to find intellectual
freedom. Disraeli the Younger, sent by his father into
the Christian Church, found there the dry bones all
turned into armed men.

Isaac Disraeli made an earnest effort to be at once
a man of letters and a member of the synagogue.
When his effort had proved vain, and he must
follow Spinoza and Mendelssohn on the path of exile,
he wrote to the wardens of Bevis Marks synagogue:
"Many of your members are already lost; many you
are losing! Even those whose tempers and feelings
would still cling to you are gradually seceding. But
against all this you are perpetually pleading your
existing laws, which you would enforce on all the
brethren alike. It is of these obsolete laws so many
complain. They were adapted by fugitives to their
peculiar situation, quite distinct from their own, and
as foreign to us as the language in which they were
written. For the new circumstances which have arisen
you are without laws."

Soon after his separation from the synagogue he
wrote his work <i>The Genius of Judaism</i>. In it is the
following passage: "The religious Judaism of the
Theocracy degenerated into Rabbinical Judaism by
fabulous traditions and enslaving customs. Dictators
of the human intellect, the Rabbins, like their successors,
the papal Christians, attempted to raise a
spurious Theocracy of their own. A race of dreaming
schoolmen contrived to place an avowed collection of
mere human decisions among the hallowed verities
and the duties of devotion, to graft opinions of men
on the scion of divine institutions; nay, even to prefer
the gloss in direct opposition to the divine precept,
whenever, as they express it, 'the tradition is not
favoured;' that is, when the oral tradition absolutely
contradicts the written law. The Jews live according
to their laws, and according to their traditions and
customs; for their traditions have become an integral
part of their written law, and their customs have been
converted into rites. The Judaic superstitions have
been substituted for the code of Revelation. We may
ask, by what enthralling witchcraft, by what perverse
ingenuity, has such a revolution been brought
about?"

In reading this I am reminded of the Russian
folk-tale of "The Devouring Sister." The Vampire
born into a family devours each member of it successively,
to the last--a brother who slays her. After
she is dead, he hears her voice gently entreating him
to think with compassion on her hard doom, and to
preserve some bit of her remains. Moved by this
appeal, the brother folds one drop of her blood in a
leaf and carries it in his bosom. When he reaches
home he falls dead; the one drop of Vampire blood
had devoured his heart. The fatal drop which Isaac
Disraeli carried away from his dead Judaism was
folded in the fine passage just quoted, as in a green
leaf: it is in the phrase, "scion of divine institutions."

There is enough in that brief creed to sustain every
persecution of reason and conscience the world ever
saw. The Sanhedrim is in it; the Inquisition is in it.
The belief that the God of the universe established
the institutions of ancient Judea is enough to eat the
human heart out of every generation that presses it,
with whatever sentiment, to its breast.

It was perfectly logical for Isaac Disraeli to have
his son baptized a Christian. Seeing in the so-called
"religion" of his race a "scion of divine institutions,"
he rightly saw in Christianity the natural expansion
and historic development of that "scion." He had
said to the synagogue, "For the new circumstances
which have arisen you are without laws." Christianity
supplied those laws. The same voice spake again
when, thirty-seven years ago, his son reminded
Christendom that it was obeying the laws and
saturated in the literature of the Jewish race; when
he claimed that Moses was summoned by Jahve "to
be the organ of an eternal revelation of the divine will."

The freethinker owes a certain debt to Lord Beaconsfield
for his logical treatment of Christianity.
That unanswerable argument of his in "A Political
Biography," that the Jews deserved gratitude for prevailing
on the Romans to crucify Jesus, so securing
the Atonement; that it was a sublime act and
sacrifice, Jews being the ordained immolators, securing
the salvation of the world; that no one has ever been
permitted to write under the inspiration of the Holy
Ghost but a Jew; that all Christians acknowledge
that the only medium of communication between
themselves and God is the Jewish race; that the
Mother of God was a Jewess; that, indeed, is a <i>reductio
ad absurdum</i>, which cannot be unwelcome to the age
of common sense. But every nail he thus drove into
the coffin of Christianity was one which had pierced the
hands and feet of humanity from Canaan to Calvary,
and from Calvary to Smithfield.

The devotion of Lord Beaconsfield to the Jewish
people was a fearful retribution on the synagogue
that drove out his father. His kiss was as fatal as it
was sincere. He taught the Jewish youth that the
path to power and glory, not merely for themselves
but for their race, lay in the direction of Christianity.
His spirit may yet survive as the Moses of a journey
through the baptismal sea to the Promised Land.
He confirmed them in every error--in all their race-egoism,
in all their indifference to the progressive
enlightenment of the world, and gave their bigotry a
new lease of life by a Christian confirmation. The
most eloquent passage he ever wrote is in <i>Tancred</i>,
in the "Feast of Tabernacles," which the <i>Jewish
World</i>, in quoting it after his death, said might
have been uttered by a <i>Chasid</i> in a moment of
inspiration: "The vineyards of Israel have ceased
to exist, but the eternal law enjoins the children of
Israel still to celebrate the vintage. A race that
persist in celebrating their vintage, although they
have no fruits to gather, will regain their vineyards.
What sublime inexorability in the law! But what
indomitable spirit in the people! It is easy for the
happier Sephardim, the Hebrews who have never
quitted the sunny regions that are laved by the Midland
Ocean; it is easy for them, though they have
lost their heritage, to sympathise in their beautiful
Asian cities or in their Moorish and Arabian gardens,
with the graceful rites that are, at least, an homage
to a benignant nature. But picture to yourself the
child of Israel in the dingy suburb or the squalid
quarter of some bleak northern town, where there is
never a sun that can at any rate ripen grapes. Yet
he must celebrate the vintage of purple Palestine!
The law has told him, though a denizen in an icy
clime, that he must dwell for seven days in a bower,
and that he must build it of the boughs of thick
trees; and the Rabbins have told him that these thick
trees are the palm, the myrtle, and the weeping
willow. Even Sarmatia may furnish a weeping
willow. The law has told him that he must pluck
the fruit of goodly trees, and the Rabbins have
explained that goodly fruit on this occasion is confined
to the citron. Perhaps, in his despair, he is
obliged to fly to the candied delicacies of the grocer.
His mercantile connections will enable him, often at
considerable cost, to procure some palm-leaves from
Canaan, which he may wave in his synagogue while
he exclaims, as the crowd did when the divine
descendant of David entered Jerusalem, 'Hosannah
in the highest!' There is something profoundly
interesting in this devoted observance of Oriental
customs in the heart of our Saxon and Sclavonian
cities; in these descendants of the Bedoueens, who
conquered Canaan more than three thousand years
ago, still celebrating that success which secured their
forefathers, for the first time, grapes and wine. Conceive
a being born and bred in the Judenstrasse of
Hamburg or Frankfort, or rather in the purlieus of
our Houndsditch or Minories, born to hereditary
insult, without any education, apparently without a
circumstance that can develop the slightest taste, or
cherish the least sentiment for the beautiful, living
amid fogs and filth, never treated with kindness,
seldom with justice, occupied with the meanest, if not
the vilest, toil--bargaining for frippery, speculating
in usury, existing for ever under the concurrent
influence of degrading causes which would have worn
out, long ago, any race that was not of the unmixed
blood of Caucasus, and did not adhere to the law of
Moses; conceive such a being, an object to you of
prejudice, dislike, disgust, perhaps hatred. The
season arrives, and the mind and heart of that being
are filled with images and passions that have been
ranked in all ages among the most beautiful and the
most genial of human experience; filled with a subject
the most vivid, the most graceful, the most
joyous, and the most exuberant; a subject which
has inspired poets, and which has made gods--the
harvest of the grape in the native regions of the vine.
He rises in the morning, goes early to some Whitechapel
market, purchases some willow-boughs for
which he has previously given a commission, and
which are brought, probably, from one of the neighbouring
rivers of Essex, hastens home, cleans out the
yard of his miserable tenement, builds his bower,
decks it, even profusely, with the finest flowers and
fruits he can procure, the myrtle and the citron never
forgotten, and hangs its roof with variegated lamps.
After the service of his synagogue, he sups late with
his wife and his children in the open air, as if he
were in the pleasant villages of Galilee, beneath its
sweet and starry sky."

"What sublime inexorability in the law!" Nay,
what binding, paralysing, mercilessness in the self-imposed
law that holds the eyes of a race for ever at
the back of its head instead of in the forehead!
In the great and grievous error of those words is
repeated once more the doom of the Wandering
Race. In them Jesus says again to Ahasuerus, "As
thou hast refused to go out in the general vineyard
of humanity, to toil and gather with the true and
earnest of all races and religions, be this thy sentence:
Keep thy small province of mouldered faith; go on,
and on, and for ever, celebrating vineyards that do not
exist, pressing dead grapes that yield no wine, waving
dead palm-leaves before a Messiah that can never
arrive, bound in thine everlasting Houndsditch round
by dreams of myrtle-bowers in a barbarian paradise
long ago turned to a Valley of Jehoshaphat!"

Lord Beaconsfield also dealt his blow to Spinoza.
He defended the rights of the Jews in Parliament on
the ground that they were all Jews, all believers in
Moses and the Prophets; and that the alternative of
this was belief in Hume and Gibbon. The day of his
burial was solemnised by the party he had led with
an effort to drive out of Parliament an Englishman
who preferred Hume and Gibbon to Moses and the
Prophets.

This is the doom of Judaism. This is Ahasuerus
bound. There is a nobility in the Ahasuerus that
Shelley evokes in <i>Queen Mab</i>, a Semitic Prometheus
bound for ever on Time and its desolations, as a rock,
with bigotry and intolerance feeding vulture-like upon
his heart because he will not bend to tyrannical Jove,
either in the form of Jahve or of Jesus; suffering
as the friend of a Humanity also groaning beneath a
celestial despotism, but cringing as he will not.
But there is nothing Promethean in the mere preference
for the chains of one tyrant over those of another.
There is nothing noble in a sect accepting its rock and
vulture through servility to a deity of whose indifference
or impotence or non-existence the history of his
worshippers is a sufficient proof. There is no majesty
in martyrdom unless it is endured for the deliverance
and welfare of all mankind. There was a time when
the Jews suffered nobly; they stood almost alone in
preserving the protest of the human mind against
priestly impostures, which could not be maintained by
the thinking Greeks and Romans--who no doubt
knew the facts as well as Lucian and Celsus--against
imperial decrees. But that time passed when thought
became free. The emancipation of the Jews politically
brought to their side Herakles--a human-hearted
deliverer--who cut their outward cords. Judaism,
remaining on its Caucasus, apart from the evolution
of humanity, is bound only by inward chains. Its
doom, in free countries, comes only from within.

It is forbidden that any man or race shall find
strength and happiness in isolation, and this race is
withheld by its traditional system and its dogmas
from co-operation with mankind in its nobler aims
and tendencies. Their fundamental error is to regard
the God of Israel as different from the Gods of other
people. Upon that rests the wild superstition that
the Jews, in some sense or other, are "a chosen people"
or "a peculiar people." It is the doctrine alike of
Christianity and Judaism; but as in the dreary past
it has been the dogma most fatal to the Jews--their
accepted supernatural eminence logically leading
to their supernatural doom--it must be equally
fatal in their future of freedom, in an intellectual sense.
So long as they are marked off in the human world in
this way they will not find rest; for that can be found
only when their genius--earning such wreaths as
adorn the brow of Spinoza and Heine, or those which
came from every capital to lie on the grave of Offenbach--is
identified with the general work and play of
the world, and their religious aims such as are
common to all who acknowledge allegiance to reason
and pursue the equal welfare of mankind.

AHASUERUS DELIVERED.


There are certain races of mankind whose history or
whose character has made them the tests of civilisation.
In one direction the negro has been such. In
the development of English self-government, on both
sides of the Atlantic, there came a time when its fine
theories of liberty were put to the test. In America
the poor ignorant negro knelt chained before the
genius of the Republic. His slavery represented
many millions of money, his freedom must cost many
thousands of lives; but Justice said, "There is that
lowly man--helpless, of alien race from you, too poor
to pay you anything: if you can do justice to him,
can make him a citizen, the world will know that you
are really a republic."

In another direction the Jewish race has been the
rest and register of civilisation. It was the one visible
embodiment of Antichrist in Christendom. While
missionaries were going through the world to convert
the world, the Jew also went through the world--moral,
religious, learned--a compulsory wanderer and
missionary, in whose scars might always be read the
spirit of the Church he opposed, and the meaning of a
vicarious atonement, whose corollary was the unending
crucifixion of a race for the offence of three or four
of their ancestors. This Wandering Jew knocked at
the doors of law-courts. "Who art thou?" said the
judges. "I am Antichrist." "Come in and be burnt,"
said they. He came in and was burnt. But ever
rising from his ashes, the Wanderer marched on.
Again, after some centuries, he knocked at the door
marked Justice. "Who art thou?" asked the judges.
"I am Antichrist," he said. "Stay out and be
mobbed," said they. And so he wandered until he
reached the century when England opened the door
and said, "Enter and receive thy right." Even Judge
Jeffreys, in the time of James II., would not accept
the old law which disabled a Jew from prosecuting a
Christian. "Pay him his money," he cried to the
defendant. "His action is not against a Christian:
you are more a Jew than he is!" At many doors this
unconquerable Antichrist had to knock in this land:
slowly, against frantic attempts to bar them, they
swung open, one after the other; and it was proved
that English justice, confronting what Christendom
called a devil, was ultimately equal to giving that
devil his due--in society, in the law-court, in the
Parliament.

The English have managed to hold superstition
more in order in their smaller territory than it is held in
Eastern Europe, yet they must not take for their own
race all the credit for the equality that has been accorded
the Jew in England. The credit is mainly due
to himself. Some forty years ago, when wild stories
reached Great Britain from Damascus and Rhodes of
how Jews were suffering horrible outrages on account
of absurd accusations--such as sacrificing Christian
priests and children--the entire English community
joined to support Sir Moses Montefiore in his mission
to repress that fanaticism. But when England had sent
Sir Moses on his noble mission, it turned to consider
its own relation to the Jews, and found on its statute-book
laws which still bore witness of the ages when
Jewish blood had mingled with Christian sacrifices.
The laws were even then--forty years ago--not all
obsolete. But some of them were, and others
have since become so, largely through the fact
that the Jews had made themselves useful to the
country.

Just now England is again called to look abroad
though nearer home, and consider the outbreak of
fanaticism in Germany.

Dr. Carl Vogt, the naturalist, recently expressed
his belief that the present persecution of Jews in
Germany is a recurrence of ancient Teutonic
barbarism. He explains Judenhetze scientifically,
on the principles of Atavism. Every now and then
there must be a recrudescence of suppressed barbarism.
Those who have read, in <i>A Tramp Abroad</i>, those
accounts of the duels witnessed by imperturbable
Mark Twain in that country--duels in which students
cut and slash each other in a friendly way, in the
intervals of drinking beer together, and flaunt their
facial gashes upon the street with pride, will suspect
that the barbarism in coming back had not far to
travel. Nevertheless, we must remember that Germany
has not yet completed that revolution which
shall bring the people under the influence of their best
heads; its great science, art, and literature are still
carried on as it were in cloisters. The throne of
Germany's noble Reason is usurped by heartless
pretenders in politics and hypocrites in religion.
Barbarossa will awake presently, and when he comes
forth from his cave it will not be in the guise of
Emperor William or Prince Bismarck, nor yet as the
priest-ridden Jew-hater, but as a cultured and
courageous People, with their feet alike on titled
despotism and parochial barbarism.

As, however, in the outrages on Jews at Damascus
and Rhodes, in the last generation, England caught
a glimpse, as in a mirror, of certain features from her
own hideous past still surviving in her laws, so one
can hardly turn from the Judenhetze of Germany
without a consciousness that there are still certain
scandals in the attitude of English Christianity
towards the Jews. The chief scandal is that there
should be an organised society for converting them--as
if they were savages.

The existence of such a society in London will one
day be quoted to show how much pious preadamitism
survived amid our telegraphs and telephones. It is
not civilised for men to suppose that a good Jew is
inferior to a good Christian. It is scandal that the
learned clergy should permit the people to suppose
that Christian churches and sects have any moral or
spiritual advantage over those who attend the
synagogue. How many mothers who teach their
children the precepts of the Sermon on the Mount, or
rehearse to them the parables of the New Testament,
pity the children of Jewish mothers as knowing
nothing of those beautiful and tender sayings? How
many of them even realise that the Golden Rule is in
the Pentateuch; and that every Jewish child learns
those sweet sayings and parables where Jesus learned
them--at his Jewish mother's knee?

It is a great misfortune that religious liberalism, in
its revolt from the primitive Judaism which Protestantism
and Puritanism restored, and which survives now
chiefly among Sabbatarian and dogmatic Christians,
has kept before the world only that ancient Jahvism
under which Canaanites were exterminated. It
has thus indirectly fostered the fallacy which regards
as Judaism much that even strict Jews have long ago
outgrown. The Jews themselves, however, as we have
seen, are largely to blame for the persistence of this
vulgar delusion; indeed, even many of their liberal
thinkers have obstinately preserved their new wine in
ceremonial bottles, with the ancient labels, and helped
to convey the popular impression that their religion
is unchanged. But it <i>is</i> changed. Even the strictest
Jews are to-day less Sabbatarian, and more emancipated
from the barbarism of sacrificial superstitions,
than Christians. When Moses Mendelssohn said that
the Jews would become Christians "when the
Christians cease to be Jews," he no doubt recognised
that Christians are preserving as dogma the Judaism
which Jews keep as a shell, but inwardly have outgrown;
and that a conversion of the Jews to
Christianity would really carry them back to Levitical
beliefs long replaced by the modern ideas prevailing
inside the hereditary and patriotic walls from which
they fear to venture.

Spinoza was as representative a Jew as ever lived,
and never more than when the synagogue disowned him.
The history of his race for a thousand years had been
to him an instruction in fidelity and independence. That
there is a vigorous Left among the Jews is apparent
in every direction; not only in Jewish scholarship,
which is assisting in the work of detaching from their
Bible and other sacred books a Hebrew Mythology,
but also in the political and social influence of Jews.
The outbreak of Judenhetze in Germany is a bad
enough symptom for the Teutons, but a hopeful sign
for the Jews. Socially they have excited jealousy by
the extent to which, having become men and women
of the world, they are able to support that character
by their wealth. Politically, they would appear to
have so completely entered into those liberal and
popular movements which they so long eschewed,
that the Imperial Power is under the necessity of
reminding them that, as in the past they suffered
from the mob, and were protected by princes, so it
may be again. The retention of the Rev. Mr. Stoecker
as Court Chaplain, while he is leading this agitation so
unscrupulously, is a confession that the anti-Semitic
movement has the encouragement of the Emperor
and his Chancellor. To awaken Teutonic jealousy of
Jewish wealth, just beginning to be displayed in the
enjoyment of Gentile luxuries; to arouse Christian
fanaticism against the growing freethought of a race
ceasing to expect any Messiah: such are the obvious
methods by which the German Government hope to
separate Jewish means and radicalism from the
masses, and drive Jews to their ancient refuge--the
strong central power always purchasable by money
and servility. What success will crown this imperial
effort remains to be seen. But that there should be a
necessity for it is a confirmation of what the late Lord
Beaconsfield asserted, and such good judges as Herr
Eydmann and Karl Blind attest, that the Jews are very
extensively concerned in popular movements on the
Continent.

That these liberal tendencies might be expected
among the Jews generally when and where they feel
assured of freedom and security, is suggested by the
history of their race in America. It is certain that
the leading Rabbins of that country would be
regarded as perilously latitudinarian by their strict
co-religionists of Europe. It is a significant unique
fact that the high family of Adlers has produced a
President of the Free Religious Association, which is
made up of theists and agnostics developed out of
Unitarianism and Transcendentalism. But, furthermore,
the leading Rabbins, Lilienthal, Wise, and
Sonnenschein, are instances of the advanced
Rationalism which pervades the Jewish body in
America. These scholarly and eloquent Rabbins
freely fraternise with the anti-supernaturalistic
teachers of other antecedents than their own. It is
pretty certain that they do not look for the advent of
any personal Messiah, and never dream of any restoration
of their race to power in Palestine. They
are not theocratic in politics, but republican, and
regard America as the real Jerusalem of their race.
Such is my conviction, based not only upon the works
of the gentlemen I have mentioned, but upon personal
acquaintance with them; and I cannot doubt that,
whatever may be their dissent from much that is
written in these pages, they would confirm my opinion
as to the tendency of the people of Jewish origin in
America. Jews of the Old World are somewhat in
the condition of the rich man who, when reproached
for a stinted charity, said that he began life poor, and
had never got the chill of poverty out of his bones;
these Jews have vivid traditions of persecution, and
have not yet got the chill of fear out of their bones.
Recent events in Germany and Russia may even prolong
this timidity; the ferocious reply to their
attempt to mingle in the society and politics of the
world may set back for a little their liberation. But
the free heart and mind of Europe is with them, and
will be felt not only in England but on the Continent.
The unbinding of Ahasuerus is part of the civilised
revolution which can never really go backward.

Shakspeare was the first to show the Jew to be
a man. Lessing was the first to show that a Jew
might be as good a man as a Christian, the indispensability
of Christ to excellence being quite ignored.
Thus the seventeenth century had its gospel for the
Jew, and the eighteenth century had its gospel. But
in essence the gospel according to Lessing was not so
high as that of the master at whose feet he learned it.
Shakspeare had raised up the standard of Manhood,
and in its light Judaism and Christianism are seen to
be comparatively small things, and their contentious
tempers proof that they are no longer religious in
any pure sense. Lessing, even in his famous apologue
of the Three Rings which a father gave to his equally
beloved sons--similitudes of the Jewish, Moslem and
Christian religions--makes the wise judge end the
dispute as to which is the true ring by consecrating
all three. The true ring, which the fond father had
caused to be copied in two others, so that neither son
might be disappointed, had the power to draw the
love of all on its owner. But it also carried the
right to sovereignty; and this advantage so overbore
the former virtue that each son, with his ring, was
found to love himself alone. The Judge advises them
to be each content with his ring:

/p
"Let each of you comport him in such wise
 As love unbribed commands; let each resolve
 To show the world that in the ring he wears
 He holds the prize, its virtues being shown
 To Man in acts of justice, meekness, mercy,
 To God in thoughts of love and heartfelt trust."
p/

But the nineteenth century should transmit to the
twentieth a nobler gospel for Jew, Moslem, and Christian
than that. Let each of them see that his ring is
a survival from the ancient chain that fettered him to
his several rock of superstition; that so long as he
holds faith in it, no transmutation of it into gold, no
decoration with opal, can make it other than a talisman
to bind him, and isolate him from the real work
of creating a Man able to be the providence of this
world. Let the rings, not only of Israel, but of
Christianity, and of all sects, be thrown into the flames
of human love, that there may be formed a coronet
for the Mother whose patient all-loving face poetry
and science are revealing. "In this principle," said
Clifford, of the evolution of organic from inorganic
things, "we must recognise the mother of life, and
especially of human life, powerful enough to subdue
the elements, and yet always working gently against
them; biding her time in the whole expanse of heaven,
to make the highest cosmos out of inorganic chaos;
the actor, not of all the actions of living things, but
only of the good actions; for a bad action is one by
which the organism tends to be less organic, and
acts for a time as if inorganic. To this mother of
life, personifying herself in the good works of humanity,
it seems to me we may fitly address a splendid hymn
of Mr. Swinburne's:

/p
"Mother of man's time-travelling generations,
   Breath of his nostrils, heart-blood of his heart,
 God above all Gods worshipped of all nations,
   Light above light, law beyond law, thou art.

"Thy face is as a sword smiting in sunder
   Shadows and chains and dreams and iron things;
 The sea is dumb before thy face, the thunder
   Silent, the skies are narrower than thy wings.

      *      *      *      *      *

"All old grey histories hiding thy clear features,
   O secret spirit and sovereign, all men's tales,
 Creeds woven of men thy children and thy creatures,
   They have woven for vestures of thee and for veils.

"Thine hands, without election or exemption,
   Feed all men fainting from false peace or strife,
 O thou, the resurrection and redemption,
   The godhead, and the manhood, and the life!"

THREE WITNESSES.


In Prague there is an ancient Synagogue, the interior
of which is black with the mould and dust of seven
centuries. There is a tradition that at some unknown
point in it the holy name of Jahve is written, and, for
fear of its obliteration, no cleansing or sweeping,
however slight, has been permitted, until now the
Synagogue has become a show-place of accumulated
dirt, which tourists pass through with torches. This
ancient structure is but a too faithful symbol of
temples which preserve the superstitions of ages
through fear that, if some holy name or creed be
touched, religion and morality will suffer.

Early in the last generation three Jewish boys--Israel,
Jacob, and Henoch--were seated together in
this Synagogue on a Saturday morning, awaiting the
beginning of service. They were of different families,
but playmates. No person was near them, and,
oblivious of the traditional prohibitions, they began
to amuse themselves by scraping off with their knives
an inch of the black mould, here and there, to see
what wood or stone was beneath. The Rabbi, happening
to pass at the time, cried out with horror at
the sacrilege, and said, "The curse of Heaven may fall
on you for that act!"

The terrified lads put up their knives. Some neighbours
who heard the voice of the angry Rabbi, but not
his exact words, reported that he had said, "May the
curse of Heaven fall on you for that act!" And this
was the form in which the story was whispered about.
Gradually a small saga grew up among the Jews of
Prague about these three boys. They were regarded
with an evil eye, under which their prospects suffered
blight; they were supposed to be under some mysterious
doom, they were avoided, and their families
suffered much distress. The venerable Rabbi, repenting
of his hasty words, tried to disabuse the minds of
his congregation as to what he had said; but he was
unable to undo what had been done. As the three
advanced towards youth, the prejudices against them,
and the belief that a doom overhung them, made their
lives so miserable, that they desired to leave Prague
altogether, and their parents thought this the best
course. The families were in good circumstances, and
the young men went off fairly well educated and with
some means. They resolved to emigrate to different
regions.

Jacob went to Northern Germany. He entered a
university there and succeeded in his studies. Animated
by the hope of doing so well in life that his
parents might ultimately have the happiness of seeing
the prejudices of their neighbours disappear, he presently
excelled all other students. He became a
favourite with the professors. But this excited the
jealousy of other students. These conspired against
him, and one of their best swordsmen was appointed
to pick a quarrel with him. The quarrel came; Jacob
was challenged; in the duel he received an ugly
wound, which deprived him of one eye, disfigured
him, and injured his health. These troubles gradually
affected his nerves to such an extent that his mind
was partially affected. He began to suspect that
there might be some truth in the belief of the neighbours
in Prague, that he had fallen under a divine
curse for having cleaned an inch of the old Synagogue-wall.
This dread grew upon him to such an
extent that, from having been a courageous youth, he
became timid. Whenever he went out at night he
seemed to be confronted by the student with whom
he had fought the duel. He began to be looked upon
as an uncanny person by the common people in the
city where he dwelt. Some even hustled him on the
street, and the Christian boys sometimes threw refuse
at the miserable man. He was one evening purposely
tripped by some one and suffered a severe fall,
which lamed him. Amid the shadows that darkened
his room, which had gradually become dingy through
poverty, he imagined that, like the patriarch after
whom he was named, he had wrestled with a dark
phantom, which, however, had prevailed against him.
The curse seemed to be fixed upon him irremissibly.
The accumulated filth of the old Synagogue of
Prague had carried with it the accumulated superstitions
of ages; his childish attempt to clear away a
little of that visible mould had been vain, and he was
now equally helpless to free any smallest space of his
own mind from hereditary beliefs in dooms, spectres,
spells. Thus he wandered, limping, miserable, amid
Christian scoffs and Jewish suspicions, and so he
wanders this day.

The second of the lads that left Prague, Israel, came
to England, where he was well educated. He thought
over this Prague incident carefully, and came to feel
a certain contempt for a Synagogue which so jealously
cherished all its dirt. He found it written in the
Talmud that "next to godliness is cleanliness," and
began to perceive that the filth he had tried to scrape
off was a type of the irrational usages and petty
exactions which had overlaid the religion of his race.
He had united himself to a Synagogue in London
which was kept fair and beautiful; but, as time wore
on, he found that around the good hearts and fine
minds of the English Jews there were walls on which
had gathered the repulsive dust and dirt of ages
transmitted from ancient Syria. So Israel resolved
that he would make good the promise of his boyish
knife, and clear away some of the spiritual mould
from English Judaism. His attempts at reform
awakened the ire of Wardens, the hostility of
Rabbins, and the opposition of a wealthy Semitic
caste. Israel still believed in Jahve, and in the
fundamental doctrines of the Jewish faith; he believed
that if Judaism could be freed from its antiquarian
walls it must lead the world. But he struggled in
vain for years to secure from the chiefs of the
Synagogues any modification of their usages. Furthermore,
his efforts in this direction began to tell seriously
upon his personal prospects. He had studied law,
been admitted to the bar, and for a time found some
employment from his co-religionists; but after it was
discovered that he was endeavouring to interfere with
the traditional usages of the Synagogue, he soon
found himself without clients, and with but a few
friends--these being of Christian families.

One evening Israel went to a theatre in London to
witness the performance of the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>.
He was much impressed by an incident of the Bible
used by Shylock as a parable, wherein Jacob stuck
wands before the ewes in breeding-time, and secured
parti-coloured lambs, which, according to Laban's
agreement, were all to fall to his (Jacob's) part.
Shylock says:

/p
"This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;
 And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not."
p/

The Christian Antonio must needs accept the
"holy witness" of a book infallible to him and Shylock
alike, and says that the result so good for Jacob was
"sway'd and fashioned by the hand of Heaven."
Israel went away from the theatre to his poor room,
and bethought him that, great as was the wealth and
power of a few Jews, the parti-coloured lambs had
somehow fallen to the Christian lot. Was the "hand
of Heaven" in this? If the declaration of Jahve of
old that his approval should be manifest in blessings,
his disapproval in cursings, were faithful, could there be
any doubt where the divine approbation rested in England?
Was Houndsditch the seal of Jahve's benediction
on his people? or was not Belgravia rather the
expression of his smile? Houndsditch and Belgravia
alike appealed to Jahve; to which had he sent the
multitude of spring lambs and the plenteous wool?

The germ that fell into Israel's mind at the theatre
gradually grew. He presently found that the
traditions of Judaism attained their real power and
glory in Christianity. In the end he was baptized;
he was speedily surrounded by troops of friends. He
possessed brilliant powers, and became eminent in
literary and political life. Even his former co-religionists
were inclined to utilise him, now that he
no longer attempted to use his pen-knife on their
mouldy customs. He was able to serve them in many
ways, they were willing to repay his services; and,
thus, assisted by the race which gained prestige
through his genius without the danger of it, and by
the Christian community which saw in him a triumph
of Christ, he became a great minister of State and a
favourite in Palaces. And such he is to this day.

The third of the three youths who left Prague,
Henoch, wandered restlessly through Asia and Europe--then
came to France. He also was a man of brilliant
powers, and for some time kept up his friendship with
young Israel in London. In the course of their correspondence,
the idea arose in him also of trying to
reform the Synagogue to which he had attached himself
in Paris. He failed in the same way, but the
effect on his mind was different. He could not recognise
a direction from Jahve in the superior thrift of
Christendom. He had heard that in America the
Jews were in every way more liberal and progressive,
and he resolved to emigrate thither. For this purpose
he engaged a passage, and repaired to Havre to take
his steamer.

On his way to the wharf in Havre, Henoch was
passing a small book-stall, when his attention was
arrested by the appearance of the bookseller. This
was an extremely aged Jew, with long white beard,
deep-set eyes, and a queer, antique figure. He sat
beside his little stand of dingy fourth-hand books,
holding a small volume in his bony fingers, which he
perused attentively. Henoch approached him and,
speaking in Hebrew, asked him what books he had
suitable for a traveller. The old man asked him
whither he was travelling, and having received the
reply, said: "Ah, that, too, was my dream; but I never
got farther than this. I am too old now--too old and
too poor--and must leave the New World hope for our
younger men. But I sit here, and read about that
land of promise, and my dim old eyes follow every
ship that sails that way." Henoch asked to look at
the book the aged Jew had been reading. It was an
old Spanish book--Herrera's <i>History of the Indies</i>.
Israel knew the language, and proposed to buy the
book. The aged bookseller was somewhat reluctant
but finally said: "It is the story of the discovery of
the New World to which you are going; take it, with
an old man's good will; and may you carry to America
something better than those Spaniards did, who tried to
plant there every evil the Old World had produced!"

On board the steamer Henoch read this book, and
one narrative in it haunted his memory. It related
that when the Spaniards had taken possession of the
newly-discovered island they called Hispaniola--now
Cuba--they began to trade in the Indians, who were
shipped off as slaves to various regions. The island
found itself in want of Indians, and having heard that
the neighbouring Lucayan Isles were full of them,
asked permission of King Ferdinand to allow them to
bring these Lucayans over to Hispaniola, "that they
might enjoy the preaching and political customs"
which they (the Spaniards) had introduced. Having
received this permission, the Spaniards went over to
the Lucayans and told those simple islanders that they
had come from the paradise of their ancestors; they
said that all whom they (the Lucayans) had loved and
lost by death were now in a happy abode, enjoying
perfect repose and every felicity; and that their ships
were ready to bear them to that happy land. The
poor Lucayans crowded with laughter and joy to the
Spanish ships; the light of the Blessed Isle shone
upon their faces. They sailed away from their island
home, where they had known only peace and friendship,
and were soon all working in dark mines under
the slave-driver's scourge. The kid was seethed in
its mother's milk.

Henoch read and re-read this tragic history, and
looked out over the sea westward. What a fearful
fate was that of hearts that followed a dream of paradise
which led them into slavery and despair! But
slavery, what is it? Is it only the subjection of one
will to another? or bondage of the body to toil for
others? May there not be islanders, even amid
continents, following dreams of paradise, and of
clasping their ancestral dead, into spiritual slavery,
into a living entombment among skeletons and
simulacra of things for ever turned to dust?

In the vision of Henoch there arose a memory of
the ancient Synagogue at Prague. His eyes filled
with tears as he recalled the dear and tender faces that
he had seen there. His kind father, his gentle mother,
the good-hearted neighbours, the once happy circle of
playmates--how fair and peaceful that Lucaya had
been! But it was all at the mercy of a bit of dirt
come down from the thirteenth century, consecrated
by awe of four letters of a dead language. Under
that spell kindly hearts had turned to stone, suspicions
arisen, fear and dread, and from the ruin of a happy
home he had been sent to wander through the world.
The dream of an ancestral paradise had made that
blackened Synagogue as dark a mine as any in which
the discoverers of the New World set the islanders to
toil; it had imprisoned the Jewish genius and chained
the Jewish heart.

One morning, when his thought was full of these
reflections, and the book received from the ancient
Jew at Havre was open before him, Henoch caught
his first sight of the New World, radiant in the sunshine.
He resolved that into that land of fresh opportunity
he would carry no dogma or custom which
rested upon tradition or authority. In that land he
saw the human race given a fresh opportunity, and he
also would begin again. The Old World had followed
its dreams of heaven through massacres and martyrdoms
into a dreary and endless routine of wrong,
which found its fit symbol in that fable his experience
could well interpret, of an eternal Wanderer.

His own race had been mainly responsible for that
fatal misdirection of the energies and enthusiasm of
the Old World which, had it not sought a Paradise
among the dead, might have made the earth a paradise
for the living. Now he would consecrate his
powers to persuade the people of the human race, to
which in America he might belong, to burn behind
them all these holy ships of Zion in which the Past
might be imported, and to receive the Past only as it
might be able to minister to science, or might come in
confessions of the moral ruin it had wrought, as a
warning for the new Age.

In the New World, Henoch began his work of
founding societies whose religion is to perform divine
service for mankind, to make every day eternal, and
to steadily transfigure man with the shining light of
science and pure raiment of a renovated world. The
wanderings of Henoch have changed to unhasting, unresting
progressions, traceable in fair transformations.
His eloquence, which has learned every sweet and
subtle tone of the Past, and caught the brave accents
of hope, wins the Christian from his cross and the
Jew from his altar. He is still a welcome Voice in the
cities, sierras, savannas, eldorados, crying <sc>The Kingdom
of Man is at hand</sc>.


THE END.
