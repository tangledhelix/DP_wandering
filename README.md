**Difficulty level:** Average.

Wordcheck is **mandatory** in the P2 and P3 rounds; I respectfully request that P1 proofers use it as well.

Polytonic Greek has been enabled for this project.

### Forum notes ###

Watch out for Greek characters. I think Guiguts may have some new tools for this.

Search with `\p{Greek}`; as mentioned in the forum post cited below, a few strays are in the English text, it seems like; handle those. There only seem to be 2 lines of legitimate Greek.

> I've noticed several cases of the OCR containing a Greek Capital Letter Mu (ie unicode U+039C) instead of what should clearly from context be the Latin letter M.
>
> It might be worth doing a search across the entire project in post processing to catch any other instances that have slipped through.

### General notes ###

> From the same source came, True likeness of the whole form of a Jew, seen by all, from Jerusalem, who pretends, etc. First printed at Augspurg, 1619.

Research indicates that "Augspurg" is a legitimate, though archaic, alternative spelling of Augsburg.

### Proofer's notes ###

p. 221: `lese[**typo?]-humanity`

I used a custom GPT configured for PP research and fed it the entire book, then inquired about this passage and the meaning of this specific term. Below is a portion of its response. See also [Wikipedia: Lèse-majesté](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lèse-majesté).

> “lese-humanity” is Conway’s deliberate adaptation of the term lèse-majesté (a crime against a sovereign).
>
> Here, Conway applies the structure metaphorically:
>
> **lèse-humanité = an offense against humanity itself**
>
> In the story, Ahasuerus finally realizes that the true enormity of his crime was not an insult against God in a theological or metaphysical sense, but a violation of what is most sacred in human beings. It was a crime against compassion, solidarity, and the shared dignity of humankind.

Based on this, I left it as-printed.

----
p. 213: `Icy Finit[**finit?] le mystère d'Ahasuérus.`

Here the proofer questions the case of the initial "f" in "Finit". After spending some time reviewing blackletter documentation, I initially guessed uppercase due to extra flourishes.

I queried ChatGPT for a while to analyze the text and try to isolate its source (which it identified as Édouard Quinet’s Romantic drama Ahasvérus (1833)). While working only in text, ChatGPT consistently thought it was lowercased.

Finally, I uploaded a screenshot of the text to it for analysis, asking for a letter-by-letter analysis of upper- vs. lower-case, and as I had originally thought, it now concluded that the F in Finit was printed as upper-case in this work. Therefore, not taking the advice from this proofer note, and leaving as uppercase.
