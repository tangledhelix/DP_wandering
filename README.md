### Forum notes ###

Watch out for Greek characters. I think Guiguts has some new tools for this.

> I've noticed several cases of the OCR containing a Greek Capital Letter Mu (ie unicode U+039C) instead of what should clearly from context be the Latin letter M.
>
> It might be worth doing a search across the entire project in post processing to catch any other instances that have slipped through.
